METHODS: We recruited 30 eyes of 30 patients who underwent phacoemulsification and randomly divided them into two groups. Acrysof Natural IQ IOLs were implanted in one group (n = 15), and Adapt-AO IOLs were implanted into the other (n = 15). A custom-built OCT instrument was used to image the IOL-PC space at 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month after surgery. Slit-lamp examination and auto refraction were performed at each visit. RESULTS: The IOL-PC spaces in the IQ group were 0.72 \u00b1 0.35, 0.40 \u00b1 0.24, and 0.23 \u00b1 0.16 mm(2) at 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month after surgery, respectively. At each of these times, the values for the AO group were significantly smaller (P < 0.001). Compared to 1 day after surgery, significant changes in the ACDs and refractive errors occurred up to 1 month postoperatively in the IQ group; however, changes in the ACD and refractive error were significant only at 1 week in the AO group. CONCLUSIONS: The decreases in IOL-PC space and in ACD during the early postoperative period were associated with a myopic shift. It appeared that the different IOL designs had a role in closure of the IOL-PC space. High resolution OCT was suitable for quantitative analysis of IOL-PC space.

SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, St. Thomas' Hospital, London, United Kingdom. METHODS: Patients in previous studies with various intraocular lenses (IOLs) and at least a 2-year follow-up were identified. Postoperative digital retroillumination images of each eye taken at 1, 3, and 6 months and 1 and 2 years were assessed for the presence of LEC islands and their incidence, etiology, time of appearance, change with time, and relationship to IOL material. RESULTS: Islands of LECs were identified in 39 eyes with an AcrySof SA60AT IOL, 40 eyes with a Rayner Centerflex C570H IOL, and 27 eyes with a Hoya YA60BB IOL. In all groups, the islands tended to appear within 6 months with a decreasing incidence thereafter. Floating LECs that seeded on the posterior capsule (seeded LECs) or LECs left on the posterior capsule at surgery were seen in a small number of eyes. Most islands were derived from regression of a previous LEC membrane, and a majority continued to regress. Intraocular lens material had no influence on the natural history or morphology of the islands. CONCLUSION: Islands of LECs were common postoperatively. Equatorial LECs appeared to be the major cause of clinical posterior capsule opacification (PCO). Floating LECs in the aqueous that seeded on the posterior capsule or LECs left behind after surgery did not appear to contribute to clinical PCO.

{"docid": 24158845, "title": "New light for old eyes: comparing melanopsin-mediated non-visual benefits of blue-light and UV-blocking intraocular lenses.", "text": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Melanopsin-expressing photosensitive retinal ganglion cells form a blue-light-sensitive non-visual system mediating diverse physiological effects including circadian entrainment and cognitive alertness. Reduced blue wavelength retinal illumination through cataract formation is thought to blunt these responses while cataract surgery and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation have been shown to have beneficial effects on sleep and cognition. We aimed to use the reaction time (RT) task and the Epworth Sleepiness Score (ESS) as a validated objective platform to compare non-visual benefits of UV- and blue-blocking IOLs. METHODS: Patients were prospectively randomised to receive either a UV- or blue-blocking IOL, performing an RT test and ESS questionnaire before and after surgery. Optical blurring at the second test controlled for visual improvement. Non-operative age-matched controls were recruited for comparison. RESULTS: 80 participants completed the study. Those undergoing first-eye phacoemulsification demonstrated significant improvements in RT over control (p=0.001) and second-eye surgery patients (p=0.03). Moreover, reduced daytime sleepiness was measured by ESS for the first-eye surgery group (p=0.008) but not for the second-eye group (p=0.09). Choice of UV- or blue-blocking IOL made no significant difference to magnitude of cognitive improvement (p=0.272). CONCLUSIONS: Phacoemulsification, particularly first-eye surgery, has a strong positive effect on cognition and daytime alertness, regardless of IOL type."}

The study was conducted at the Angers University Hospital, France. This was a prospective with a lowercase pilot study, including consecutive patients planned to undergo cataract surgery in both eyes within 1\u00a0week. The same type of IOL was used in both eyes of each patient. The choice of IOL was not randomized but driven by the habits and experience of each participating surgeon. Cognitively healthy patients (an MMSE score higher than 25) were assessed before and after surgery, using the 30-item geriatric depression scale (GDS) to seek symptoms of depression. Univariate and multiple logistic regressions were used to examine the association between the type of IOL and the 30-item GDS score improvement during the 3\u00a0months after lens implantation, while adjusting for participants' characteristics (age, visual acuity). Blue-filtering IOLs were used in 16 patients (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation, 75.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.5\u00a0years; 75\u00a0% female), and untinted IOLs in 18 patients (77.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.9\u00a0years; 77.8\u00a0%female). Pre-operatively visual acuity and GDS scores were comparable in the two groups. The post-operative GDS score was improved by 1.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.10 points in the whole sample (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002), as well as in each subgroup of patients.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: The right eyes of 16 healthy participants and 13 RP patients. METHODS: Pupil responses to red and blue light (peak, 485 and 625 nm, respectively) presented by 76 light-emitting diodes, 1.8-mm spot size at different locations of a 16.2\u00b0 VF were recorded. Subjective VFs of RP patients were determined using chromatic dark-adapted Goldmann VFs (CDA-GVFs). Six healthy participants underwent 2 pupillometer examinations to determine test-retest reliability. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Three parameters of pupil contraction were determined automatically: percentage of change of pupil size (PPC), maximum contraction velocity (MCV; in pixels per second), and latency of MCV (LMCV; in seconds). The fraction of functional VF was determined by CDA-GVF. RESULTS: In healthy participants, higher PPC and MCV were measured in response to blue compared with red light. The LMCV in response to blue light was relatively constant throughout the VF. Healthy participants demonstrated higher PPC and MCV and shorter LMCV in central compared with peripheral test points in response to red light. Test-retest correlation coefficients were 0.7 for PPC and 0.5 for MCV. In RP patients, test point in which the PPC and MCV were lower than 4 standard errors from the mean of healthy participants correlated with areas that were indicated as nonseeing by CDA-GVF. The mean absolute deviation in LMCV parameter in response to the red light between different test point was significantly higher in RP patients (range, 0.16-0.47) than in healthy participants (range, 0.02-0.16; P < 0.0001) and indicated its usefulness as a diagnostic tool with high sensitivity and specificity (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 0.97, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon analysis). Randomly reducing the number of test points to a total of 15 points did not significantly reduce the AUC in RP diagnosis based on this parameter. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using a chromatic multifocal pupillometer for objective diagnosis of RP and assessment of VF defects."}

METHODS: Twenty-eight eyes of 14 patients diagnosed with STGD were imaged using a novel high-speed, large-field PS-OCT system and FAF (excitation 488 nm, emission > 500 nm). The ophthalmoscopic phenotype was classified into three groups. ABCA4 mutation testing detected 15 STGD alleles, six of which harbor novel mutations. RESULTS: STGD phenotype 1 (12 eyes) showed sharply delineated areas of absent RPE signal on RPE segmentation B-scans of PS-OCT correlating with areas of hypofluorescence on FAF. Adjacent areas of irregular fluorescence correlated with an irregular RPE segmentation line with absence of overlaying photoreceptor layers. Eyes characterized on OCT by a gap in the subfoveal outer segment layer (foveal cavitation) showed a normal RPE segmentation line on PS-OCT. Hyperfluorescent flecks on FAF in phenotype 2 STGD (8 eyes) were identified as clusters of depolarizing material at the level of the RPE. Distribution of flecks could be depicted on RPE elevation maps. An increased amount of depolarizing material in the choroid was characteristic for STGD Phenotype 3 (8 eyes). CONCLUSIONS: PS-OCT together with FAF identified characteristic patterns of changes in different stages of the disease. PS-OCT is a promising new tool for diagnosis and evaluation of future treatment modalities in STGD."}

Densitometric examination of the negatives showed a significant increase in the amount of red light and a significant decrease in the amount of blue light reflected from the anterior surface of the lens (third image) in the group of old subjects as compared to the group of young persons. There is also a significant decline in the blue light reflected from the posterior surface of the lens (fourth image) but no change in the red light in old versus young eyes. From these results it is suggested that the index of refraction of the lens increases for red (nC) and decreases for blue light (nF) in the aging eye and similarly the index of the vitreous varies differentially in blue and red light. These specific changes in the indices of the lens and vitreous are believed to account for the large decline of axial chromatic aberration of the aging eye. In addition, the examination of the first Purkinje-Sanson image tends to indicate that the index of refraction of the cornea does not vary with age."}

DESIGN: Interventional case series. METHODS: Retrospective review of eight eyes of eight patients who underwent submacular surgery for CNV after having previously received verteporfin ocular photodynamic therapy for presumed ocular histoplasmosis (one patient), age-related macular degeneration ([AMD] three patients) pathologic myopia (two patients), punctate inner choroiditis (one patient), and idiopathic CNV (one patient). All cases had undergone ocular photodynamic therapy with verteporfin using standard protocols. Six of eight patients suffered a submacular hemorrhage after ocular photodynamic therapy, and two of eight patients refused further ocular photodynamic therapy. All patients subsequently had submacular surgery with removal of the CNV. One membrane was routinely processed, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Five membranes were stained with toluidine blue for light microscopic examination. Semithin (1.0 microm) sections were cut and stained with uranyl acetate-lead citrate for transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: Choroidal neovascular membranes were removed at 3 days (presumed ocular histoplasmosis), 29 days (punctate inner choroiditis), 63 days (AMD, pathologic myopia), 66 days (AMD), 107 days (pathologic myopia), 116 days (AMD), and 152 days (idiopathic) after verteporfin ocular photodynamic therapy. Histopathologic and ultrastructural examination showed areas of vascular occlusion at 3 days that were not seen at later time points. All specimens had patent CNV. There were signs of vascular damage with extravasated erythrocytes and fibrin, pigment clumping in cells, and inflammatory cells in all but the 3-day specimen. CONCLUSIONS: This case series presents data only from patients who refused repeat treatment with ocular photodynamic therapy or who developed submacular hemorrhage after initial photodynamic therapy. Histopathologic evaluation of CNV 3 days after verteporfin ocular photodynamic therapy showed partial vascular occlusion that was not present in later specimens. These later specimens demonstrated evidence of vascular damage. Verteporfin ocular photodynamic therapy does not appear to lead to permanent and complete occlusion of the CNV. Thus, treatments that lead to permanent closure of CNV without damage to the retinal pigment epithelium and sensory retina are still needed."}

DESIGN: Randomized, controlled, double-masked, and bilateral study with intraindividual comparison. PARTICIPANTS: This study included 48 eyes of 24 consecutive patients with age-related cataract. METHODS: Each patient had standardized small incision cataract surgery with IOL implantation into the capsular bag. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a blue-light-filtering Hoya AF-1 (UY) YA-60BB IOL in one eye and a UV-filtering Hoya AF-1 (UV) VA-60BB IOL (Hoya Medical Europe, Frankfurt/Main, Germany) in the contralateral eye. Contrast acuity was measured at illumination levels of 500, 5, and 0.5 lux and contrast levels of 100%, 50%, 25%, 12.5%, and 6.25%. Color vision was assessed using the Lanthony desaturated D-15 test, the Lanthony new color test (Munsell chroma 2 and 4), and an anomaloscope. Blue/yellow foveal threshold was tested applying short-wave automated perimetry. The subjective visual impression of patients was evaluated using a questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Contrast acuity, color vision, and foveal threshold. RESULTS: The blue-light-filtering IOLs had worse contrast acuity (P = 0.0004) and foveal threshold (P = 0.008) compared with the UV-filtering IOLs. Color vision tests and high-contrast visual acuity did not show any statistically significant differences between IOLs (P>0.05). On questioning, 3 of 24 patients noticed a difference between the implanted IOLs concerning visual impression. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that blue-light-filtering IOLs negatively affect contrast acuity and blue/yellow foveal threshold when compared with UV-filtering IOLs. Although the differences were small, the results suggest bilateral implantation of the same IOL type and avoidance of a mixed implantation of a blue-light-filtering IOL in one and a non-blue-light-filtering IOL in the contralateral eye in patients with high demands in color vision.

Epidemiologic studies suggest that insufficient dietary lutein and zeaxanthin intake or lower serum zeaxanthin levels are associated with increased risk for AMD. The objective of this work is to test the protective effects of lutein and zeaxanthin against photooxidative damage to retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) and oxidation-induced changes in expression of inflammation-related genes. To mimic lipofuscin-mediated photooxidation in vivo, we used ARPE-19 cells that accumulated A2E, a lipofuscin fluorophore and photosensitizer, as a model system to investigate the effects of lutein and zeaxanthin supplementation. The data show that supplementation with lutein or zeaxanthin in the medium resulted in accumulation of lutein or zeaxanthin in the RPE cells. The concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin in the cells were 2- to 14-fold of that detected in the medium, indicating that ARPE-19 cells actively take up lutein or zeaxanthin. As compared with untreated cells, exposure of A2E-containing RPE to blue light resulted in a 40-60% decrease in proteasome activity, a 50-80% decrease in expression of CFH and MCP-1, and an~20-fold increase in expression of IL-8. The photooxidation-induced changes in expression of MCP-1, IL-8, and CFH were similar to those caused by chemical inhibition of the proteasome, suggesting that inactivation of the proteasome is involved in the photooxidation-induced alteration in expression of these inflammation-related genes. Incubation of the A2E-containing RPE with lutein or zeaxanthin prior to blue light exposure significantly attenuated the photooxidation-induced inactivation of the proteasome and photooxidation-induced changes in expression of MCP-1, IL-8, and CFH. Together, these data indicate that lutein or zeaxanthin modulates inflammatory responses in cultured RPE in response to photooxidation. Protecting the proteasome from oxidative inactivation appears to be one of the mechanisms by which lutein and zeaxanthin modulate the inflammatory response. Similar mechanisms may explain salutary effects of lutein and zeaxanthin in reducing the risk for AMD."}

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients in each group underwent phacoemulsification of both eyes. Both eyes of each patient received an aspherical IOL (SW60AT) or a similar standard IOL (SN60AT). The integrity of ocular function was assessed with clinical examination before surgery. Postoperative examination (1 month after the second surgery) included best visual acuity, an aberrometry with a 5-mm pupil (Bausch and Lomb), and a contrast vision (Zalonghi scale) in scotopic place examination. RESULTS: We noted no statistically significant difference between the two groups before surgery. Best spectacle-corrected visual acuity improved in both groups with no difference (8.15/10+/-1.39/10 and 7.95/10+/-1.54/10 for the aspheric group eyes and 7.85/10+/-2.13/10 and 7.60/10+/-2.14/10 for the standard group eyes). Otherwise, a statistically significant difference was found for the Z40 aberration with RMS=0.0095 with SW60AT versus RMS=0.07625 with SN60AT. The pupils had a similar size in both groups. There were no statistically significant differences for contrast sensitivity between two IOLs; nevertheless, contrast vision seemed to be better with the aspherical lens (33.15+/-6.85 points and 32.15+/-6.95 points for the standard group eyes and 36.05+/-3.63 points and 35.70+/-3.93/10 points for the aspheric eyes).

RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in preoperative and postoperative refractive error and best corrected visual acuity existed between the groups. When comparing the Tecnis IOL with the AR40e IOL, contrast sensitivity testing showed significantly better results in the Tecnis group at 3 and 12 cpd in photopic conditions; at 3, 12 and 18 cpd in photopic with glare; at 3, 12 and 18 cpd in mesopic and at 12 and 18 cpd in mesopic with glare. The Tecnis IOL provided significantly better contrast sensitivity at almost all spatial frequencies in any lighting condition in comparison with the SN60AT IOL. CONCLUSION: Implantation of a modified prolate IOL may improve quality of vision as demonstrated by our clinical results of contrast sensitivity testing.

{"docid": 16792735, "title": "Supplementation with the carotenoids lutein or zeaxanthin improves human visual performance.", "text": "BACKGROUND: Macular pigment (MP) is found in diurnal primate species when vision spans a range of ambient illumination and is mediated by cone and rod photoreceptors. The exact role of MP remains to be determined. In this study we investigate two new hypotheses for possible MP functions. OBJECTIVE: As MP absorption coincides partly with that of rhodopsin, MP may reduce rod signal effectiveness in the mesopic range, thus extend the usefulness of cone-mediated vision into the mesopic range. Forward light scatter in the eye can reduce retinal image contrast. If blue light contributes significantly to intraocular scatter, selective blue light absorption by MP could reduce the effects of scatter. DESIGN: We investigated 34 subjects from a carotenoid supplementation trial. The measurements included high mesopic contrast acuity thresholds (CATs), macular pigment optical density (MPOD), wavefront aberrations, and scattered light. The measurements were made after 6 months of daily supplementation with zeaxanthin (Z, OPTISHARP), lutein (L), a combination of the two (C), or placebo (P), and again after a further 6 months of doubled supplementation. RESULTS: The data reveal a trend toward lower CATs in all groups supplemented, with a statistically significant improvement in the lutein group (p = 0.001), although there was no correlation with MPOD. Light scattering in the eye and the root-mean-square wavefront aberrations show decreasing trends as a result of supplementation, but no correlation with MPOD. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that supplementation with L or Z increases MPOD at the fovea and at 2.5 degrees , and that supplementation can improve CATs at high mesopic levels and hence visual performance at low illumination."}

{"docid": 16834830, "title": "The economic impact of blue-light filtering intraocular lenses on age-related macular degeneration associated with cataract surgery: a third-party payer's perspective.", "text": "OBJECTIVES: Epidemiological data support an association between age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataract surgery that may be attributed to post-operative blue light exposure. By limiting the retina's blue light exposure, new blue-light filtering intraocular lenses (BLF IOLs) have the potential to reduce the development of AMD following cataract surgery. In the current economic healthcare environment, there is increased interest in the cost impact of new medical technologies. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the cost impact of a BLF IOL versus a non-BLF IOL in cataract surgery. METHODS: An economic model was developed to emulate three age-specific cohorts and to assess the clinical and economic outcomes over 5 years. Data from the published literature was supplemented with clinical expert opinion. Key literature inputs involved the risk of AMD after cataract surgery as well as laboratory and animal data on the effectiveness of the BLF IOL in reducing the risk of AMD. Clinical experts provided information on the management of AMD. Direct medical costs including the cost of the IOL, monitoring, and AMD prophylaxis and treatment were incorporated into the model. All costs were standardized to 2004 US dollars. Age-stratified sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: In the BLF IOL group, the 5-year age-stratified incidence of AMD ranged from 0.58 to 9.23 per 100 eyes, compared with 1.69 to 24.55 per 100 eyes in the non-BLF IOL group. The incremental cost of the BLF was offset by reduced costs associated with averted AMD treatment. Estimated savings with BLF IOLs per 100 eyes were $4275, $29 997, and $111 734 in the 55 to 64 year-old, 65 to 74 year-old, and >or= 75-year-old cohorts, respectively; these findings remained robust throughout the sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Limitations of this analysis include the lack of prospective clinical trial data that definitively demonstrate the efficacy of a BLF IOL in preventing AMD. Moreover, the efficacy data used to populate the model were derived from laboratory and animal studies. Thus, based on preliminary data, this study suggests that the economic benefits of implanting BLF IOLs during cataract surgery are observed in all patients over a 5-year timeframe although cost savings are greatest in patients >or= 75 years."}

METHODS: Twenty eyes of 17 patients were implanted with the AcrySof Natural IQ aspheric IOL (SN60WF) and 20 eyes of 15 patients were implanted with the AcrySof Natural spherical IOL (SN60AT). Photopic monocular distance best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) was recorded at 6 months postoperatively. Corneal aberrations were measured with the CSO Eyetop topographer, and ocular aberrations were measured with a Hartmann-Shack aberrometer for a 6-mm pupil. Ocular spherical aberration was computed for different pupil diameters (3, 4, 5, and 6 mm). RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found between the BSCVA of the AcrySof IQ IOL (0.023 +/- 0.004 logMAR) and AcrySof Natural IOL (0.031 +/- 0.003 logMAR) (P = .15). The corneal higher order aberrations showed no statistically significant differences between groups (P > .1). However, spherical aberration and higher order ocular aberrations in the AcrySof IQ eyes were lower than eyes implanted with the AcrySof Natural IOL (P < .01). A statistically significant increase in the spherical aberration coefficient with pupil diameter was found only for the spherical IOL group (P = .0023). Statistically significant differences in the spherical aberration coefficient were found between groups at all pupil diameters (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: A significant reduction in ocular spherical aberration was noted after AcrySof IQ IOL implantation at all pupil diameters compared to the spherical IOL, although photopic BSCVA between groups remained similar."}

SETTING: Ankara University School of Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology, Ankara, Turkey. METHODS: Right eyes of 38 patients with an AcrySof Natural IOL and right eyes of 38 age-matched patients with a conventional AcrySof SA60AT IOL were included in a study. Contrast sensitivity was measured with the Functional Acuity Contrast Test under photopic conditions. Scotopic contrast sensitivity in the presence or absence of glare was measured using the Mesotest II (Oculus GmbH). Blue-green color vision was evaluated with the Moreland equation of the HMC Anomaloskop MR (Oculus GmbH). RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 66.6 years +/- 8.2 (SD) in the Natural IOL group and 66.4 +/- 8.0 years in the conventional IOL group. There was no statistically significant difference in photopic contrast sensitivity, scotopic contrast sensitivity with and without glare, or disability glare between the 2 groups (P>.05). Photopic and scotopic contrast sensitivity with and without glare significantly decreased with age in both groups (P<.01).

DESIGN: Prospective, comparative case series. PARTICIPANTS: The MPOD levels were measured in 480 eyes of 337 patients after cataract surgery. Among them, the data from 259 eyes (clear IOL group, 121 eyes; yellow-tinted IOL group, 138 eyes) of 259 Japanese patients were selected for statistical analyses on the basis of the inclusion criteria: a postoperative visual acuity (VA) of \u22650.8 and no fundus diseases. Only 1 eye of each patient was enrolled. Patients provided informed consent to participate in this study on the basis of the approval of the institutional review board before surgery. METHODS: The patients selected the type of IOL to be implanted. The MPOD levels were measured using resonance Raman spectroscopy on day 1 (baseline value); months 1, 3, and 6; and years 1 and 2 postoperatively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The difference in MPOD levels between the IOL groups was analyzed by unpaired t tests. The following parameters were analyzed by multiple regression analysis: age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking history, glaucoma, diabetes, preoperative VA, preoperative refractive error, and IOL power and type. RESULTS: We found no significant differences in the baseline characteristics between the 2 groups. Until 6 months postoperatively, the MPOD levels did not differ significantly between the groups. However, from 1 year onward, the levels were significantly higher in the yellow-tinted IOL group compared with the clear IOL group. By multiple regression analysis, 1 day postoperatively, older age and diabetes were correlated with lower MPOD levels; 1 year postoperatively and thereafter, however, lower MPOD levels were correlated with clear IOLs. CONCLUSIONS: Cataract surgery with clear IOLs induced a greater decrease in macular pigment levels compared with yellow-tinted IOLs during a longer follow-up period. These findings agreed with observations that excessive light exposure is associated inversely with MPOD, because clear IOLs transmit higher intensities of blue light than yellow-tinted IOLs."}
{"docid": 17260315, "title": "[Visual function with blue light filter IOLs].", "text": "BACKGROUND: Recently, intraocular lenses (IOLs) with a blue light filter have been introduced to protect the retina from age-related macular degeneration (AMD) after cataract extraction. A reduction of longitudinal chromatic aberration by filtering blue light may enhance patient's visual function. In this study we compared subjective and objective parameters of visual function following implantation of blue light filter (yellow) IOLs and IOLs of the same design without filter. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 21 patients (21 eyes) underwent implantation of an IOL with a blue light filter (AF-1 UY, Hoya, Japan), 22 patients (22 eyes) received an IOL without blue light filter (AF-1 UV, Hoya, Japan). Patients were examined three months postoperatively for uncorrected and best corrected spectacle visual acuity, mesopic and photopic contrast sensitivity, colour vision and subjective quality of vision by a standard questionnaire. RESULTS: Eyes with blue light filter IOLs did not show any significant difference in any parameter analysed when compared to eyes without the blue light filter IOL. Subjective quality of vision was considered to be high by all patients and no significant difference was observed between the two IOL groups. CONCLUSION: The visual function of patients with blue filter IOLs is not significantly different to those without blue light filter IOLs. Since blue light filter IOLs did not show any functional disadvantage, but potentially protect the macula from AMD, blue light filter IOLs may be considered as a reasonable alternative to traditional IOLs, especially in eyes with a high risk for the development of macular degeneration."}

SETTING: Multicenter U.S. clinical trial. METHODS: In a prospective randomized patient-masked multicenter study, 150 patients received the AcrySof Natural IOL and 147 patients received the AcrySof single-piece IOL as a control. Patients with bilateral age-related cataracts who were willing and able to wait at least 30 days between cataract procedures and had verified normal preoperative color vision were eligible for the study. Standardized surgery included a 4.0 to 5.0 mm capsulorhexis and phacoemulsification. All lenses were inserted in the capsular bag, with verification of in-the-bag placement of both haptics. In all bilateral implantation cases, the same model IOL was used in each eye. Postoperatively, contrast sensitivity and color perception were measured up to 180 days and up to 1 year (for visual acuity) after implantation. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were discovered between the 2 patient groups in visual acuity, contrast sensitivity evaluated under mesopic and photopic conditions, or the number of patients who passed the Farnsworth D-15 color perception test. There were no lens-related adverse events in either group. CONCLUSIONS: The blue-light filtering AcrySof Natural IOL was equivalent to the conventional AcrySof lens in terms of postoperative visual performance. Additional long-term clinical studies should show whether the IOL actually provides the theoretical benefits to retinal health."}

All patients were scheduled for fluorescein angiography between three and six months after surgery; 228 angiograms were obtained that were readable for the presence or absence of angiographic CME. The mean interval following surgery was 4.3 months. The incidence of CME was 18.8% (21 of 112) in patients who received lenses without UV-filtering chromophore and 9.5% (11 of 116) in patients who received IOLs that contained UV-filtering chromophore.

METHODS: In this prospective case series, 10 patients (17 eyes) underwent cataract surgery via a 3.2\u00a0mm clear corneal incision. A continuous circular capsulorhexis with <6\u00a0mm diameter was employed. A capsular tension ring and HOYA yellow foldable posterior chamber intraocular lens was implanted. All patients wore color contact lenses postoperatively. Paired t test was used to compare visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and corneal endothelial changes before and after surgery. RESULTS: A single surgeon performed all surgeries. The best-corrected visual acuity improved from value 1.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.27LogMAR preoperatively to value 0.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.26LogMAR postoperatively (p\u00a0=\u00a00.000). The photophobic symptoms improved significantly after surgery.

{"docid": 28002333, "title": "Impact of blue-light filtering intraocular lens implantation on the quality of sleep in patients after cataract surgery.", "text": "BACKGROUND: There are 2 main types of intraocular lens (IOL) currently implanted in patients after cataract surgery. Till now, we do not know exactly what the effect of intraocular lens implantation will be on the quality of sleep after cataract surgery. METHODS: The binocular BF-IOL (BF-IOL Groups) and UVB-IOL (UVB-IOL Groups) implantations were performed in 60 and 59 cataract patients, respectively. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaires were administered to evaluate the quality of sleep in patients preoperatively, 1 month (1 m) and 12 months (12 m) postoperatively. Independent sample test and \u03c7 test were used to evaluate the difference between the 2 groups; one-way ANOVA was used to evaluate the difference preoperatively and postoperatively in each group. The rank sum test was used for statistical analysis of 7 independent sleep components in PSQI. RESULTS: As compared to preoperatively, the PSQI overall scores in both groups improved significantly postoperatively (P\u200a=\u200a0.00 at 1 m and 12 m). Among the 7 components of PSQI, 2 of them (sleep latency and daytime dysfunction) improved greatly postoperatively in both groups (P< 0.05). Although the improvement of PSQI overall score in the UVB-IOL group was greater than that in the BF-IOL Group only at early time (1 m) postoperatively (P\u200a=\u200a0.00), but not late time (12 m, P > 0.05) after the cataract surgery. CONCLUSION: The sleep quality of cataract patients improved after IOL implantation, regardless of the type of IOL, suggesting that BF-IOL might serve as an alternative to conventional UVB-IOL without a detrimental effect on quality of sleep after cataract surgery."}
{"docid": 17159440, "title": "Is cataract surgery a risk factor for progression of macular degeneration?", "text": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is a suggestion of increased risk or progression of age-related macular degeneration after cataract surgery, which is related to the increased exposure of the retina to short-wavelength light. RECENT FINDINGS: Cell culture and animal work has described retinal and retinal pigment epithelium phototoxicity on acute light exposure. Clinical studies suggest that the use of short-wavelength-blocking intraocular lenses can help but may also affect visual function and circadian rhythm. SUMMARY: Evidence to date fails to prove conclusively that light alone or cataract surgery can induce or cause the progression of age-related macular degeneration. A randomized clinical study of the use of short-wavelength (blue)-blocking lenses to prove or disprove the ability of these intraocular lenses to help in preventing progression of age-related macular degeneration is needed."}

SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. DESIGN: Clinical trial. METHODS: Eyes with age-related cataract had cataract surgery with implantation of a nonaccommodating IOL (AF-1 YA-60BB). Surgery was performed with primary posterior CCC and posterior buttonholing in 1 eye (study eyes) and with conventional in-the-bag implantation in the contralateral eye (control eyes). After a minimum of 6 months postoperatively, the anterior chamber depth was assessed with partial coherence interferometry before and after application of pilocarpine 2.0% and, after a washout interval of 1 week, before and after the application of cyclopentolate 1.0%. RESULTS: Forty eyes of 20 patients were enrolled. A slight backward shift of the IOL (+78 \u03bcm) in study eyes and in control eyes (+118 \u03bcm) was detected after pilocarpine application (both P<.05). No significant difference in IOL shift was found between study eyes and control eyes (P=.19). CONCLUSIONS: Combined primary posterior CCC and posterior optic buttonholing did not affect IOL shift during pharmacologically stimulated ciliary muscle contraction compared with in-the-bag implanted IOLs. Capsule fibrosis diminished with primary posterior CCC but did not seem to be the only limiting factor in the accommodative IOL shift.

METHODS: This prospective randomized controlled study comprised patients with bilateral cataract who received an aspheric AcrySof SN60WF IOL or a spherical AcrySof SN60AT IOL in the first eye and the other IOL in the second eye. Assessments at 3 and 6 months included 100% and 9% logMAR best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and photopic and mesopic functional acuity contrast testing. Total internal and corneal aberrations and depth of focus were computed. Distance-corrected near logMAR acuity was available at 12 months. RESULTS: At 3 and 6 months, there was no significant difference in 100% and 9% BCVA or photopic contrast sensitivity. Mesopic contrast sensitivity was better and total and internal spherical aberrations were significantly less with the aspheric IOL. Total and internal eye vertical coma was reduced with aspheric IOL. Total MTF was not significantly different between groups. The aspheric IOL group had 0.46 diopter less depth of focus than the spherical IOL group at 6 months (P<.05). Distance-corrected near acuity was significantly better with the spherical IOL. CONCLUSIONS: Aspheric IOLs significantly reduced spherical aberration, improving mesopic contrast sensitivity. Vertical coma was reduced with aspheric IOLs. Reduction of aberrations may be responsible for reduced depth of focus with aspheric IOLs. This may be disadvantageous for near vision and reading ability."}

METHODS: Intraocular lenses were obtained from human cadavers (49 IOLs total; 36 with blue-light filter) and from finished-goods inventory (controls). The IOLs were removed from cadaver eyes and the power and model matched to unused controls. After surface proteins were removed, the IOLs were hydrated for 24 hours at room temperature. Surface light scattering was measured with a Scheimpflug camera (EAS-1000 Anterior Segment Analysis System). Light transmittance was measured with a Lambda 35 UV/Vis spectrophotometer (single-beam configuration; RSA-PE-20 integrating sphere). RESULTS: Hydrated scatter values ranged from 4.8 to 202.5 computer-compatible tape (CCT) units for explanted IOLs with blue-light filter and 1.5 to 11.8 CCT units for controls; values ranged from 6.0 to 137.5 CCT units for explanted IOLs without a blue-light filter and 3.5 to 9.6 CCT units for controls. In both groups, there was a tendency toward increasing scatter values with increasing postoperative time. No differences in light transmittance were observed between explanted IOLs and controls in both groups (IOLs with blue-light filter: P=.407; IOL with no blue-light filter: P=.487; both paired t test). CONCLUSIONS: Although surface light scattering of explanted IOLs was significantly higher than that of controls and appeared to increase with time, no effect was observed on light transmittance of 1-piece hydrophobic acrylic IOLs with or without a blue-light filter."}
{"docid": 21951571, "title": "Reaction time as a measure of enhanced blue-light mediated cognitive function following cataract surgery.", "text": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Since 2002 the discovery of a novel population of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, expressing the photopigment melanopsin, has attracted broad interest in human blue-light mediated non-visual effects including circadian regulation and cognitive function. Ageing is associated with insomnia and cognitive decline. It has been postulated that reduced blue-light transmission through the formation of cataract impairs melanopsin dependant non-visual brain responses mediated by intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. We aimed to establish if any objective improvement in cognition could be demonstrated using a reaction time task (RTT) following cataract surgery and intraocular lens implantation. METHODS: Following strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, 15 patients (age range 59-87, mean 75.4 years) with bilateral cataract performed the RTT before and after surgery on one eye. The mean and the SD of two modalities of reaction time, namely complex reaction time and simple reaction time, were measured and analysed. RESULTS: Responses became both quicker and more consistent following surgery, with statistically significant improvements in the complex reaction time (p=0.016) and the complex reaction time SD (p=0.055), which were not due to a learning effect or improved vision. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that improved blue-light transmission following cataract surgery has a beneficial effect on cognitive function. We advocate the RTT as an objective platform for exploring these benefits in large sample randomised controlled trials."}

DESIGN: Randomized, prospective study. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred twenty-four eyes from 262 cataract surgery patients implanted with 2 IOL models: the AcrySof IQ (262 eyes) and AcrySof SN60AT (262 eyes; Alcon Laboratories, Fort Worth, TX). METHODS: High-contrast photopic best-corrected distance visual acuity (BCVA) and CS under photopic (85 cd/m(2)) and mesopic (6 cd/m(2)) conditions were measured. Pupil diameter was analyzed for distance vision under both lighting conditions. Follow-up was carried out for 6 months in all patients. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Best-corrected distance visual acuity and photopic and mesopic CS after implantation under monocular and binocular conditions. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in BCVA were found between either IOL (0.06+/-0.06 and 0.05+/-0.07 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution units for AcrySof SN60AT and AcrySof IQ groups, respectively; P = 0.091). One hundred percent of patients achieved BCVA of 20/32 or better in both groups. The percentage of patients who achieved BCVA of 20/25 or better was 86.3%. The AcrySof IQ IOL group showed better monocular and binocular CS at 6, 12, and 18 cpd under photopic conditions and at 3, 6, 12, and 18 cpd under mesopic conditions (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Eyes implanted with the aspheric AcrySof IQ IOL showed better photopic and mesopic CS at medium and high spatial frequencies than eyes implanted with the spherical AcrySof SN60AT IOL. High-contrast photopic BCVA was similar between both IOLs. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): The author(s) have no proprietary or commercial interest in any materials discussed in this article."}

SETTING: Peking University Third Hospital, Peking University Eye Center, Beijing, China. METHODS: Cataract patients with different types of IOLs were enrolled 3 months postoperatively. Overall and partial color discrimination under photopic (1000 lux) and mesopic (40 lux) conditions were evaluated with the Farnsworth-Munsell (FM) 100-hue test. Corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) was tested under both conditions. Subjective visual quality was assessed with the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25). RESULTS: The study evaluated 43 patients with a blue light-filtering IOL (15 photochromic, 13 yellow tinted) or an IOL filtering ultraviolet light only (n = 15). The difference in the FM 100-hue total error scores under photopic or mesopic conditions was not statistically significant between groups. There were no statistically significant differences in partial error scores in the 10 bands of the FM 100-hue color circle under photopic conditions. Under mesopic condition, there were statistically significant differences in partial error scores in the green to blue-green band (color caps 36 to 46) and the blue-green to blue band (color caps 46 to 54) (P = .005 and P = .030, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences in mean overall or subheading NEI VFQ-25 scores. CONCLUSIONS: Filtering blue lights under mesopic conditions seemed to modify color discrimination in the green-to-blue bands postoperatively. The modification did not disturb overall color discrimination or cause subjective discomfort."}

Hexaethyldisiloxane was used as an end group to control the molecular weight of the polymer. The generated polymers had a consistency suitable for injection into the empty lens capsule. The polymers contained a low ratio of polymerisable groups so that, in the presence of a photo-initiator, they could be cured on demand in situ within 5 min under irradiation of blue light to form an intraocular lens within the lens capsule. All resulting polysiloxane soft gels had a low elastic modulus and thus should be able to restore accommodation. The pre-cure viscosity and post-cure modulus of the generated polysiloxanes were controlled by the end group and D\u2084(AM) concentrations respectively in the re-equilibration reactions. The refractive index could be precisely controlled by adjusting the aromatic ratio in the polymer to suit such application as an artificial lens. Lens stretching experiments with both human and non-human primate cadaver lenses of different ages refilled with polysiloxane polymers provided a significant increase in amplitude of accommodation (up to 4 D more than that of the respective natural lens). Both in vitro cytotoxicity study using L929 cell lines and in vivo biocompatibility study in rabbit models demonstrated the non-cytotoxicity and ocular biocompatibility of the polymer."}

As blocking blue light may be to the patient's detriment, this study was designed to evaluate visual function following implantation of a blue-blocking (Acrysof Natural) IOL. METHODS: Patients were recruited for this non-randomized controlled interventional study, from those attending a private rural ophthalmology clinic for cataract surgery (n = 93). Only those who had previously had a conventional IOL implanted into one eye were offered an Acrysof Natural IOL for the second eye. Postoperatively patients underwent refracted Snellen visual acuity, contrast sensitivity using a CSV-1000E instrument and colour vision testing using a Farnsworth D-15 test, with a subset (n = 20) undergoing a Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue test. Results were then compared between eyes. Finally, a subset (n = 63) completed a survey designed to assess the subjective impact of the Acrysof Natural IOL. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between eyes implanted with conventional IOLs compared with Acrysof Natural IOLs for visual acuity (t = 0.57; P = 0.57), contrast sensitivity (t = 0.43; P = 0.67 for 3 cycles per degree [cpd], t = 0.56; P = 0.58 for 6 cpd, t = 0.09; P = 0.93 for 12 cpd and t = 0.16; P = 0.87 for 18 cpd) or colour vision with the Farnsworth D-15 (Chi(2) = 0.38; P = 0.55) or the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue test t = 0.34; P = 0.74). Most subjects reported that they could not tell a difference between the two IOLs subjectively or that any difference experienced was not significant. CONCLUSION: Our sample did not show any significant differences between eyes implanted with conventional IOLs and the Acrysof Natural IOL. We would suggest that the Acrysof Natural IOL may be used without any significant difference in visual function."}
{"docid": 1788533, "title": "Ocular exposure to solar ultraviolet and visible radiation at high latitudes.", "text": "Exposure of the eyes to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and short wavelength light, blue light, from the sun was assessed under realistic geometric conditions. A spectroradiometer with a double monochromator was used to determine the spectral irradiance at 1-nm intervals within the wavelength range of 250-800 nm. Biological weighting functions were used to calculate the blue-light radiance and the weighted UV irradiance. In addition, a photometer with a 1 degree angle of view was used to measure the ambient luminance. The results indicate that sizable amounts of UV radiation and blue light can be reflected from different environmental surroundings. Hence various groups of outdoor workers seem to be at risk of chronic ocular overexposure to solar radiation. When occupational exposure limits for UV and visible radiation are revised, the risks of chronic exposure should receive more consideration than to date."}

METHODS: Randomized, prospective study. 260 patients/eyes were randomized to receive two intraocular lens types: Alcon Acrysof Natural (136 eyes) and Acrysof IQ (124 eyes). Quality of vision was measured by visual acuity and contrast sensitivity under mesopic and photopic conditions. Ocular aberrations for 4.0- and 6.0-mm pupil were measured with Allegretto Wavelight Analyzer. All ophthalmologic were performed 7, 30 and 90 days postoperatively. Visual function index (VF-14) questionnaires for cataract symptoms were performed 90 days after surgery by all the patients. RESULTS: After 90 days, all eyes had mean postoperative best spectacle-corrected visual acuity 0.75. Eyes with the Acrysof IQ had significantly higher contrast sensitivity than eyes with the Acrysof Natural at high and middle spatial frequencies. A significant reduction in spherical aberration after Acrysof IQ implantation was achieved. The Acrysof IQ also had lower values of high-order aberration with 4.0- and 6.0-mm pupil when compared with the AcrySof Natural. CONCLUSION: Results show the aspheric Acrysof IQ induced significantly less high-order aberration and spherical aberration compared with the Acrysof Natural. Contrast sensitivity revealed better values with the Acrysof IQ intraocular lens."}

METHODS: This prospective randomized 3-month study included eyes that received 1 of the 3 IOL models with standard surgery and postoperative care. Anterior chamber cells were assessed at the slitlamp and anterior chamber flare values, with a Kowa 500 flare meter. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients (59 eyes) with a mean age of 72.7 years were evaluated. Group 1 and Group 2 comprised 20 eyes each and Group 3, 19 eyes. No eye had anterior chamber cells at baseline. In all 3 groups, the presence of anterior chamber cells was highest 1 week postoperatively and generally decreased at subsequent visits, with no statistically significant differences between IOL groups at 1 week (P = .2655), 1 month (P = .073), or 3 months (P = .5766). A similar proportion of eyes in each IOL group had residual cells in the anterior chamber at 3 months; the cells were not clinically significant. In all groups, the mean flare values were low (<11 photons/ms) at baseline (P = .4522) and statistically similar between groups at each subsequent visit (P>or=.2801). There were no adverse events. CONCLUSION: The 3 IOLs models, including the blue light-filtering model, had similar anterior chamber cells and flare values over a 3-month period, showing the lack of difference in inflammation induced by cataract surgery with implantation of the 3 similar IOL models."}

SETTING: Scientific consultant and Department of Biological Structure and National Primate Research Center, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA. METHODS: Three of 8 action spectra for circadian photoentrainment published from 2001 to 2007 were used to compute the relative effectiveness of the cumulative photon flux absorption from 400 to 600 nm reaching the retina from 4 light sources through the cornea, pupil, and 6 lenses. RESULTS: The effectiveness of the tinted IOL was 35% to 54% and 69% to 114% greater with the action spectra of 2002 to 2007, with a peak around 484 nm and 492 nm, respectively, compared with the 2001 action spectra, with a peak around 460 nm. The difference in effectiveness between the 2 IOLs ranged from 32% to 12%. With newer action spectra, differences in effectiveness between the tinted IOL and the lenses of a young standard observer and a 30- to 39-year-old were age dependent (+7% to -10% and +6% to -13%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The tinted IOL was significantly more effective for photoentrainment of the circadian rhythm with newer action spectra. The computational results suggest that the effectiveness of the tinted IOL in 60- to 85-year-old patients would be within +6% to -13% of that in 30 to 39 year olds. Both tinted and untinted IOLs are expected to be effective for melatonin suppression under average household illumination."}

METHODS: A retrospective comparative study of 63 consecutive eyes with ERM operated on with internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling using or not filtered IFCG diluted (5:1) in glucose 5%. Main outcome measures were best-corrected visual acuity, central visual field perimetry, fluorescein angiography with blue light fundus photograph, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and in seven eyes multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG). RESULTS: A total of 44 eyes underwent surgery with ILM staining using IFCG and 19 eyes without. In the IFCG group, the staining showed that the ILM was removed together with the ERM in 39% of eyes; ILM was still present on the macula after ERM removal in 57% of eyes and removed secondarily. The improvement in vision was slightly better in the IFCG group throughout follow-up but the difference was not significant. On the postoperative blue light photograph, defects in the optic nerve fibre layer were less frequent in the group with IFCG than without (p=0.023), suggesting less peroperative trauma. Two eyes in the group operated without IFCG had recurrence of the ERM including one with a macular hole vs none in the group with IFCG. No difference was observed in the groups as regards central visual field testing, mfERG, OCT, or angiographic data. CONCLUSIONS: Using IFCG for ILM peeling in ERM surgery seemed to reduce significantly the trauma to the optic nerve fiber layer and to prevent ERM recurrence. Deleterious effects were not observed in this study."}

The primary outcome measures were contrast sensitivity and blue-on-yellow perimetry values (mean deviation [MD] and pattern standard deviation [PSD]) investigated two years after surgery. The results were compared intra-individually. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant between-group (aspherical and spherical intraocular lens) difference in contrast sensitivity under photopic conditions at 12 cycles per degree and under mesopic conditions at all spatial frequencies. There were no between-group significant differences (yellow tinted and clear intraocular lens) under photopic or mesopic conditions. There was no statistically significant difference between all intraocular lens in MD or PSD. CONCLUSION: Contrast sensitivity was better under mesopic conditions with aspherical intraocular lens. Blue-on-yellow perimetry did not appear to be affected by aspherical or yellow tinted intraocular lens. Further studies with a larger sample should be carried out to confirm or not that hypotheses."}

SETTING: Storm Eye Institute, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, USA. METHODS: This retrospective chart review comprised eyes having uneventful phacoemulsification and implantation of 1 of 3 AcrySof IOLs: ReSTOR SN60D3 (multifocal spherical group), Natural SN60AT (monofocal spherical group), or IQ SN60WF (monofocal aspheric group). Eyes were matched by age, sex, and follow-up. The PCO rate, Nd:YAG capsulotomy rate, time from surgery to PCO diagnosis, and time from surgery to Nd:YAG capsulotomy were assessed. RESULTS: Charts of 225 eyes (75 in each group) with a mean follow-up of 15.9 months +/- 6.5 (SD) were evaluated. The PCO rate was 42.7% in the multifocal spherical group, 28.0% in the monofocal spherical group, and 14.7% in the monofocal aspheric group. The Nd:YAG capsulotomy rate was 25.3%, 17.3%, and 4.0%, respectively. The difference in the Nd:YAG rate was statistically significantly higher in the multifocal and monofocal spherical groups than in the monofocal aspheric group (P<.001 and P<.008, respectively) but was not significantly different between the 2 spherical IOL groups (P = .232). The time from surgery to PCO documentation was not significantly different between the 3 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Intraocular lens configuration may have contributed to the difference in the PCO rate between the 2 spherical IOLs and the aspheric IOL. Based on the Nd:YAG rate as an indicator for visual significance, PCO may be less visually significant in eyes with the aspheric IOL than in eyes with 1 of the spherical IOLs."}

SETTING: Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. METHODS: In this prospective study, age-matched subjects who passed the Ishihara test and had visual acuities of 20/25 or better were recruited. There were 2 pseudophakic groups (bilateral SN60AT or SA60AT IOLs) and 1 phakic group. The Farnsworth-Munsell (FM) 100-hue test was administered to each subject twice under different conditions. The phakic and AcrySof Natural SN60AT groups were tested under photopic and mesopic conditions. The SA60AT subjects were further divided into subgroups (with and without yellow clip-on lenses) and tested under photopic and mesopic conditions. RESULTS: A 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the square-root-transformed total error score showed no statistical differences (P = .637) between the treatment groups. Similarly, a 1-way ANOVA of the red-green error score (P = .729) and blue-yellow error score (P = .484) indicated no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups. The ANOVA results of the FM 100-hue test under mesopic conditions showed that the total error score in the AcrySof Natural IOL group was significantly lower (P = .046) than in the phakic group.

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter cohort trial. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1685 patients (206-239 eyes per trial site) were recruited consecutively at 7 study sites. The patients featured age-related cataracts and were undergoing unilateral cataract surgery in the period between January 2007 and August 2008. METHODS: Only patients with uncomplicated age-related cataracts were included. Cataract surgery was performed by phacoemulsification. The SN60AT (Alcon, Inc., Fort Worth, TX) intraocular lens (IOL) was used as a study lens. The IOL power was calculated using the SRK-T formula with a standardized A constant. Biometry was performed with the IOL Master (Carl Zeiss Meditex, Jena, Germany). Only highly experienced senior surgeons were involved. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome indicators 1 month and 3 months after surgery were the respective achievement of: (1) maximum absolute deviation of 0.5 diopter (D) between target refraction and postoperative spherical equivalent (primary end point, refractive accuracy); (2) best-corrected visual acuity of at least 0.8 (secondary end point, visual acuity outcome). RESULTS: In the pooled data, maximum absolute deviation of \u00b1 0.5 D from target refraction was achieved in 80% (95% confidence interval, 78%-82%) of cases. Visual acuity of 0.8 or more was reached in 87% (95% confidence interval, 80%-93%) of cases. The results from the trial centers differed significantly in the outcomes of the primary and secondary end points (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The study quantified benchmark levels for 2 outcome indicators in a standardized cataract surgery procedure. External confounding factors such as the comorbidity of patients, which cannot be influenced by the surgeon, were excluded. The derived benchmarks selectively illustrate the quality of the surgery and are superior to success rates published in the literature from unspecific data collections. This method is more suited for improving outcome quality by benchmarking. General methodologic problems are discussed, leading to recommendations for future study designs.

METHODS: Visual acuity (VA, logMAR), contrast sensitivity (Pelli-Robson) and colour vision (D15) were recorded for 39 patients (average age 79.1 \u00b1 7.2 years) with age-related macular degeneration, both in the presence and absence of glare from a fluorescent source. Patients then chose their preferred coloured and matched neutral density transmission filters (NoIR). Visual function tests were repeated with the chosen filters, both in the presence and absence of glare from the fluorescent source. Patients trialled the two filters for two weeks each, in random order. Following the trial of each filter, a telephone questionnaire was completed. RESULTS: VA and contrast sensitivity were unaffected by the coloured filters but reduced through the neutral density filters (p < 0.01). VA and contrast sensitivity were reduced by similar amounts, following the introduction of the glare source, both in the presence and absence of filters (p < 0.001). Colour vision error scores were increased following the introduction of a neutral density filter (from 177.6 \u00b1 60.2 to 251.9 \u00b1 115.2) and still further through coloured filters (275.1 \u00b1 50.8; p < 0.001). In the absence of any filter, colour vision error scores increased by 29.1 \u00b1 55.60 units in the presence of glare (F2,107 = 3.9, p = 0.02); however, there was little change in colour vision error scores, in the presence of glare, with either the neutral density or coloured filters. Questionnaires indicated that patients tended to gain more benefit from the coloured filters. CONCLUSIONS: Coloured filters had minimal impact on VA and contrast sensitivity in patients with age-related macular degeneration; however, they caused a small reduction in objective colour vision, although this was not registered subjectively by patients. Patients indicated that they received more benefit from the coloured filters compared with neutral density filters."}

Subjective improvements in contrast sensitivity and glare sensitivity are additional beneficial effects of such glasses. Because of the relatively high costs the prescription of cut-off filters is limited. To establish an objective criterion for prescription we performed psychophysical tests of contrast sensitivity in 12 RP patients with and without cut-off filters. We used a computerized test (Neuroscientific, New York, NY) in which six spatially different static sinusoidal grid patterns were presented on a high-resolution monitor (Joyce). Contrast-transfer functions were derived by a two-alternative forced choice method. Only 2 of the 12 tested patients--all of whom reported subjective beneficial effects of the cut-off filters on contrast sensitivity--showed significant improvement in the test. In 5 patients we found non-significant improvement while 5 showed nearly no change. Patients with low contrast sensitivity showed a relatively high benefit from the filters, especially with low spatial frequencies. However, in the majority of RP patients the method used here cannot provide objective criteria for the prescription of cut-off filters."}

This has been referred to as an encysted bleb, and some have recommended surgical techniques to repair it and to restore controlled IOP. This clinical picture occurred in 18 of 181 eyes (10%) undergoing simple trabeculectomy with a limbus-based conjunctival flap and tenonectomy. It did not occur among 69 eyes in which trabeculectomy with a fornix-based flap was combined with extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE). Its occurrence may, therefore, be related to surgical technique. In eyes with this syndrome, the authors used IOP-lowering eyedrops and/or pills, along with continued corticosteroid eyedrops. None required surgical manipulation. All 18 eyes achieved long-term IOP control, and in 14 all medications were ultimately discontinued.

Best corrected visual acuity was observed 1 day, 1 week and 1 month postoperatively, while contrast sensitivity and subjective vision were observed 1 month later. RESULTS: Best corrected visual acuity was obviously better in KS-3Ai group than in the other groups 1 day postoperatively (P < 0.05), but no significant difference was found 1 week and 1 month later among the groups (P > 0.05). When the pupil diameter was in 2.5 to 4.0 mm and 5.0 to 6.0 mm, AcrySof IQ and KS-3Ai groups were better than the AcrySof Natural group in the low and middle spatial frequency (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference between AcrySof IQ and KS-3Ai groups (P > 0.05). VF/QOL questionnaire was obtained, showing that implantation with AcrySof IQ and KS-3Ai satisfied patients preferably. CONCLUSIONS: Aspheric intraocular lens can greatly improve patients' contrast sensitivity and quality of vision."}

METHODS: Wavefront analysis was conducted on 28 eyes of 28 patients that underwent un-complicated phacoemulsification with implantation of either SN60WF (15 eyes) or SN60AT lenses (13 eyes). Eyes with a history of uveitis, retinal diseases, and previous surgery were excluded. RESULTS: SN60WF eyes had less mean absolute spherical aberration than SN60AT eyes both at 4 mm (0.04+/-0.03 vs 0.11+/-0.03 RMS, p<0.0001) and 6 mm pupils (0.09+/-0.04 vs 0.43+/-0.12 RMS, p<0.0001). Mean total HOAs was lower in the SN60WF group at 6 mm pupils (0.44+/-0.14 vs 0.56+/-0.13 RMS, p=0.0274), while no difference was seen at 4 mm pupils (0.20+/-0.10 vs 0.25+/-0.08 RMS, p=0.160). There were no clinically significant differences between the SN60WF and SN60AT IOLs both at 4 and 6 mm pupils in terms of coma (0.16+/-0.07 vs 0.18+/-0.09 RMS, p=0.514 and 0.25+/-0.12 vs 0.23+/-0.12 RMS, p=0.664) and trefoil (0.14+/-0.09 vs 0.10+/-0.05 RMS, p=0.167 and 0.28+/-0.12 vs 0.23+/-0.07 RMS, p=0.199). There were no differences be-tween groups in mean age, axial length, postoperative spherical equivalent, IOL power, or corneal curvature. CONCLUSIONS: An aspheric posterior optic IOL design with thinner center effectively reduces the positive ocular spherical aberration observed in the pseudophakic and elderly eyes, especially at larger pupillary diameters (6 mm), with no notable increase in coma. However, reduction in total ocular HOAs was only significant at 6 mm pupils."}

Macular pigment (MP), consisting of the carotenoids lutein (L), zeaxanthin (Z) and meso-Z, has a maximum absorption at 460 nm and protects the retina from (photo)-oxidative injury. This study was designed to investigate whether the blue light-filtering properties of the Alcon AcrySof Natural intraocular lens (ANIOL) implanted during cataract surgery affects MP optical density (MPOD). METHODS: Forty-two patients scheduled for cataract surgery were recruited for the study. These patients all had a preoperative best corrected visual acuity rating (BCVAR) of at least 0.5 (logMAR) in the study eye. The patients were randomized to have either the standard Alcon AcrySof three-piece acrylic intraocular lens (AIOL) (controls) or the ANIOL implanted at the time of cataract surgery. The spatial profile of MPOD (i.e., at 0.25 degrees, 0.5 degrees, 1.0 degrees, and 1.75 degrees eccentricity) was measured with customized heterochromatic flicker photometry (cHFP) 1 week before and 1 week after surgery, and at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. Serum concentrations of L and Z were also measured at each study visit. RESULTS: There was a highly significant and positive correlation between all MPODs (e.g., at 0.25 degrees) recorded 1 week before and after surgery in eyes with an AIOL implant (r = 0.915, P < 0.01; paired samples t-test, P = 0.631) and in those ANIOL implants (r = 0.868, P < 0.01; paired samples t-test, P = 0.719). Average MPOD across the retina increased significantly with time (after 3 months) in the ANIOL group (repeated-measures, general linear model, P < 0.05), but remained stable in the AIOL group (repeated-measures, general linear model, P > 0.05). There were no significant time or lens effects observed for serum L over the study period (P > 0.05). There was a significant time effect for serum Z over the study period (P < 0.05), but not a significant time/lens interaction (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Customized HFP can reliably measure the MPOD spatial profile in the presence of lens opacity, and cataract surgery does not artifactually alter MPOD readings. This study also provides evidence that implanting an IOL that filters blue light is associated with augmentation of MPOD in the absence of raised serum concentrations of L and Z. However, further and longitudinal study is needed to assess whether the observed increase in MPOD after implantation of blue-filtering IOLs is associated with reduced risk of AMD development and/or progression."}

METHODS: An easy to use filtration-compensated collimator was constructed of plastic, lead and aluminium and used randomly with a group of 32 children (mean age 11 years) undergoing cephalometric radiography before receiving orthodontic treatment. The radiation doses administered to patients (eye lens and thyroid, submandibular and parotid glands) and to the chassis of the radiographic equipment were determined. RESULTS: The filtration-compensated collimator is easily fixed to the external surface of the radiographic equipment and results in (a) as collimator, a reduction of 40% in the surface irradiated in the children and of 61.4% in the dose administered to the thyroid glands (P<0.001); (b) as filtration compensator, a reduction of 32.8% administered to the eye lens (P<0.001), 31.45% to the submaxillary gland (P<0.01) and 11.4% to the parotid gland (P<0.05); there was no difference in the dose determined on the radiographic film.

Eighteen patients with AION (10 unilateral, 8 bilateral) and 29 age-matched control subjects underwent chromatic pupillometry. Red and blue light stimuli increasing in 0.5 log steps were presented to each eye independently under conditions of dark and light adaptation. The recorded pupil contraction was plotted against stimulus intensity to generate scotopic and photopic response curves for assessment of synaptically-mediated ipRGC activity. Bright blue light stimuli presented monocularly and binocularly were used for melanopsin activation. The post-stimulus pupil size (PSPS) at the 6th second following stimulus offset was the marker of intrinsic ipRGC activity. Finally, questionnaires were administered to assess the influence of ipRGCs on sleep. The pupil response and PSPS to all monocularly-presented light stimuli were impaired in AION eyes, indicating ipRGC dysfunction. To binocular light stimulation, the PSPS of AION patients was similar to that of controls. There was no difference in the sleep habits of the two groups. Thus after ischemic injury to one or both optic nerves, the summated intrinsic ipRGC activity is preserved when both eyes receive adequate light exposure."}

METHODS: This prospective study included 120 eyes from 92 patients who were randomized to receive one of four lenses, including three aspheric lenses (Acrysof SN60WF, Tecnis ZA9000, and Hoya Py60AD) and one spherical lens (Acrysof SN60AT). Contrast sensitivity, higher-order aberrations of the whole eye, and pupil diameter under photopic and mesopic conditions were measured 1 month postoperatively. Higher-order aberrations were decomposed into Zernike coefficients, calculated according to individual pupil diameter. The correlation between higher-order aberrations and contrast sensitivity was evaluated. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in contrast sensitivity function between the four types of lenses under photopic conditions. However, the contrast sensitivity function and area under log contrast sensitivity function in the aspheric lenses were significantly better than in the spherical lens under mesopic conditions. Under mesopic conditions, spherical aberration in eyes with aspheric lenses was significantly lower than in eyes with spherical lenses (P < 0.05). Under photopic conditions, coma aberration had a significant negative correlation with contrast sensitivity at 12 cycles/degree. Under mesopic conditions, spherical aberration had a significant negative correlation with contrast sensitivity at 3, 6, and 12 cycles/degree with glare, and with contrast sensitivity at 6 and 18 cycles/degree without glare. CONCLUSION: In terms of influence on visual function, coma aberration may be more significant under photopic conditions and spherical aberration under mesopic conditions."}

METHODS: Patients with age-related cataract had bilateral standardized small-incision Kelman phacoemulsification-based cataract surgery with implantation of a blue light-filtering IOL (Oculaid PC 440Y Orange Series) in 1 eye and a UV light-filtering IOL (Oculaid PC 430 Elite Series) in the other eye. Outcome measures included scotopic and photopic corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) and photopic uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), color discrimination, and contrast sensitivity with and without glare. A questionnaire was used to assess patient satisfaction. Postoperative follow-up visits were scheduled at 1, 3, and 6 months. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (44 eyes) completed the study. There were no statistically significant differences in UDVA, CDVA, or contrast sensitivity with or without glare between the 2\u00a0IOL groups. Color discrimination was significantly decreased in eyes with blue light-filtering IOLs compared with UV light-filtering IOLs, except along the red-green axis (P=.118). No subjective differences in color or light perception were found. CONCLUSIONS: Both IOL types provided similar postoperative visual function except color perception, which was slightly better in eyes with a clear IOL. Although differences were not clinically significant, information about potential disturbances in color vision might be provided before implanting an orange blue light-filtering IOL.

A great deal of research has focused on their beneficial roles in eye health. The present article summarises the current literature related to the bioactivity of these carotenoids, emphasising their effects and possible mechanisms of action in relation to human eye health. Available evidence demonstrates that lutein and zeaxanthin are widely distributed in a number of body tissues and are uniquely concentrated in the retina and lens, indicating that each has a possible specific function in these two vital ocular tissues. Most of epidemiological studies and clinical trials support the notion that lutein and zeaxanthin have a potential role in the prevention and treatment of certain eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, cataract and retinitis pigmentosa. The biological mechanisms for the protective effects of these carotenoids may include powerful blue-light filtering activities and antioxidant properties. Although most studies point towards significant health benefits from lutein and zeaxanthin, further large-scale randomised supplementation trials are needed to define their effects on ocular function in health and disease."}

The presence of a basal laminar deposit, hard and soft drusen, thickening and calcification of Bruch's membrane, geographic atrophy, subretinal neovascularisation, and disciform scars was assessed in a standardised way. An age-matched series of 126 postmortem phakic eyes was used as control group. There was no difference between the two groups, except for a higher prevalence of hard drusen (exact trend test, p = 0.038) and disciform scars for the pseudophakic eyes (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.007). There was no significant correlation between either age-related changes in the macula or disciform degeneration and the length of time between cataract surgery and death. No significant difference was found between pseudophakic eyes with or without ultraviolet filter. These findings do not confirm that disciform scar formation is caused by an increase in ultraviolet or blue light."}

METHODS: A prospective study included 14 patients with inflammatory CME and best-corrected visual acuity between 0.1 and 0.8 (CME group) and 16 sex-, age-, and best-corrected visual acuity-matched patients with macular disorders but no CME (non-CME group). All patients from both groups underwent the following tests: determination of visual acuity at distance, contrast sensitivity (CS) testing; and subjective grading of each TF for best-corrected visual acuity and CS compared with no TFs. All tests were performed with the following TFs: Corning photochromic filter with a cutoff at 450 nm; Zeiss filter with a cutoff at 560 nm; and cheap widely available yellow filter with a cutoff at 489 nm. RESULTS: Without TFs, the CME and non-CME groups did not differ in best-corrected visual acuity (P = 0.79). Using the TFs, a clinically significant improvement was not achieved by any patient. However, using the definition of any improvement, best-corrected visual acuity with all TFs showed a significant improvement in the CME group compared with no TFs (P < 0.01). The CME group rated the Corning photochromic filter with a cutoff of 450 nm significantly higher than the other TFs when determining visual acuity (P = 0.05) and CS (P = 0.01) in contrast to no improvement in the non-CME group. CONCLUSION: Although the use of TFs for the CME patients was not associated with criteria of clinically significant improvement, our results indicate that visual acuity and CS in patients with inflammatory CME might benefit from the use of TFs."}

METHODS: Thirty patients (60 eyes) with senile cataract had both cataracts extracted, and an IOL was implanted at least 2 years before clinical evaluation. In one eye, AcrySof SA60AT (a UV-light filtering IOL) was implanted, whereas in the contralateral eye, AcrySof IQ SN60WF (a blue-light filtering IOL) was implanted. Each patient underwent visual acuity testing, color vision testing (Ishihara and Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue tests), and contrast sensitivity (CS) testing. The macula was evaluated with optical coherence tomography and with clinical examination. Patients were asked if they noted any difference between the implanted IOLs concerning visual impression. Subjective visual quality was evaluated using the National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire. RESULTS: There was a borderline statistically significant difference in the mean best-corrected visual acuity (p = 0.05). As regards color vision, no significant changes in Ishihara and Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue error scores were detected between both eyes (p = 0.48 and p = 0.59, respectively). Analysis of CS showed no significant difference between the groups at any spatial frequency. There were also no statistically significant differences in central macular thickness and total macular volume between the two IOL groups (p = 0.72 and p = 0.61, respectively). In both IOL groups, three eyes developed an epiretinal membrane, and six eyes developed early signs of age-related macular degeneration. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed no significant effects of a blue-light filtering IOL on visual acuity and no influence on color perception and CS. After more than 2 years, there were no significant differences in macular changes between the IOL groups.

{"docid": 25680758, "title": "Photochemical approaches to vision restoration.", "text": "Photoswitches are traditional pharmacologic agonists, antagonists, or channel blockers that are covalently modified with an azobenzene derivative. Azobenzene undergoes wavelength-dependent isomerization between cis and trans conformation. For some photoswitches, only one of these configurations is biologically active, resulting in light-dependent activation or inhibition of function. Photoswitches that feature a quaternary ammonium coupled to the azobenzene moiety cause light-dependent neuronal depolarization due to blockage of voltage-gated potassium channels. Two photoswitch strategies have been pursued. In the one-component strategy, the photoswitch is applied to native receptors; in the two-component strategy, the photoswitch is combined with virally-mediated expression of a genetically modified receptor, to which the photoswitch may covalently bind. The former approach is simpler but the latter allows precise anatomic targeting of photoswitch activity. Acrylamide-azobenzene-quaternary ammonium (AAQ) is the prototypical first-generation one-component photoswitch. When applied to retinas with outer retinal degeneration, ganglion cell firing occurs in response to blue light, and is abrogated by green light. In vivo, AAQ restored pupillary light responses and behavioral light responses in blind animals. DENAQ is a prototypical second generation one-component photoswitch. It features spontaneous thermal relaxation so cell firing ceases in dark, and features a red-shifted activation spectrum. Interestingly, DENAQ only photoswitches in retinas with outer retinal degeneration. MAG is a photoswitched glutamate analog which covalently binds to a modified ionotropic glutamate receptor, LiGluR. When applied together, MAG and LiGluR also rescue physiologic and behavioral light responses in blind mice. Together, photoswitch compounds offer a potentially useful approach to restoration of vision in outer retinal degeneration."}

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of severe central visual acuity loss in elderly people and seems to be an economic problem, too. There is evidence that oxidative damage is an important factor for exacerbation of AMD. Macular pigment with its antioxidative effect may serve as\"natural sunglasses\" filtering the blue light acting as a possible source of photooxidative damage to the neurosensory retina. The macular pigment consists mostly of lutein and zeaxanthin. These micronutrients from the group of carotenoids, as is the case for vitamins (vitamins C, E, and beta-carotene), cannot be synthesized in mammals and that is the reason why the role of micronutrition or its supplementation and its correlation to AMD progression has been discussed for years. The results of currently published studies are often contradictory. At present there are no results from randomized controlled studies confirming that supplementation of lutein and zeaxanthin can reduce the risk for AMD. Several epidemiological studies investigating the impact of antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids on the incidence of AMD provided conflicting results.Up to now, AREDS is the largest randomized controlled study investigating the effect of supplementation of antioxidants, zinc, and copper on the progression of AMD. AREDS showed a significant effect of this supplementation in some particular groups of patients with AMD. The supplementation of lutein and omega-3 fatty acids is not toxic but a positive effect has not been proven by randomized studies."}

METHODS: In this retrospective longitudinal study we evaluated patients receiving 0.7\u2005mg DEX intravitreal implant for active SC despite maximal systemic immunosuppression. Medical history was reviewed over a period of 18\u2005months for each patient. We diagnosed SC activity using direct fundus examination and blue-light fundus autofluorescence. Primary outcomes were the rate of disease control and functional changes at end of follow-up. Secondary outcomes were the incidence of injection-related adverse events and the success of immunosuppression tapering at the last examination. RESULTS: We examined eight eyes of seven patients. We controlled SC activity with one injection in five eyes, two injections in one eye, and three injections in two eyes (total of 13 implants). Best-corrected visual acuity at the end of the investigational period improved in two eyes (25%), remained stable in four eyes (50%) and decreased in two eyes (25%). Three eyes showed transient intraocular pressure increase and two eyes disclosed cataract progression. The average dosage of systemic prednisone at baseline and after DEX intravitreal implant decreased from 8.8 to 2.8\u2005mg/day.

SETTING: Ludwig Boltzmann Institute of Retinology and Biomicroscopic Laser-Surgery, Department of Ophthalmology, Rudolf Foundation Clinic, Vienna, Austria. DESIGN: Comparative case series. METHODS: Eyes were randomized to 1 of the following IOLs: AF-1 (UY) (yellow tinted), AcrySof SN60AT (yellow tinted), AF-1 (UV) (clear), or AcrySof SA60AT (clear). One week and 2 months postoperatively, monocular contrast sensitivity function and color discrimination were tested and the corrected distance and near visual acuities were evaluated. All tests were performed under different light intensities (10 to 1000 lux). RESULTS: Of the 80 patients enrolled, 76 completed the study; there were 37 eyes in the yellow-tinted IOL group and 39 in the clear IOL group. There were no significant differences between yellow-tinted IOLs and clear IOLs except in color vision under mesopic conditions (10 lux). Patients with a yellow-tinted IOL made significantly more mistakes in the blue-light spectrum than patients with clear IOLs (P = .00015). There was no significant difference under photopic conditions (1000 lux). CONCLUSIONS: The yellow-tinted IOLs were equivalent to the clear IOLs in postoperative contrast sensitivity, visual acuity, and color perception under photopic conditions.

Recent evidence has implicated blue light-sensitive intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) in contributing to the neural circuitry mediating photophobia in migraine sufferers. The goal of this work is to test the hypothesis that ipRGC function is altered in TBI patients with photophobia by assessing pupillary responses to blue and red light. METHODS: Twenty-four case participants (mean age 43.3; 58% female), with mild TBI and self-reported photophobia, and 12 control participants (mean age 42.6; 58% female) were in this study. After 10 minutes of dark adaptation, blue (470 nm, 1 \u00d7 10 phots/s/cm) and red (625 nm, 7 \u00d7 10 phots/s/cm) flashing (0.1 Hz) light stimuli were delivered for 30 seconds to the dilated left eye while the right pupil was recorded. The amplitude of normalized pupil fluctuation (constriction and dilation) was quantified using Fourier fast transforms. RESULTS: In both case and control participants, the amplitude of pupil fluctuation was significantly less for the blue light stimuli as compared to the red light stimuli, consistent with a contribution of ipRGCs to these pupil responses. There was no significant difference in the mean pupil fluctuation amplitudes between the two participant groups, but case participants displayed greater variability in their pupil responses to the blue stimulus. CONCLUSIONS: Case and control participants showed robust ipRGC-mediated components in their pupil responses to blue light. The results did not support the hypothesis that ipRGCs are \"hypersensitive\" to light in TBI participants with photophobia. However, greater pupil response variability in the case subjects suggests that ipRGC function may be more heterogeneous in this group."}

Fifteen trials (1690 eyes) were included for systematic review, and 11 of 15 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that there were no significant differences in postoperative mean best corrected visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, overall color vision, or in the blue light spectrum under photopic light conditions between blue light-filtering IOLs and UV light-filtering IOLs [WMD\u200a=\u200a-0.01, 95%CI (-0.03, 0.01), P\u200a=\u200a0.46; WMD\u200a=\u200a0.07, 95%CI (-0.04, 0.19), P\u200a=\u200a0.20; SMD\u200a=\u200a0.14, 95%CI (-0.33, 0.60), P\u200a=\u200a0.566; SMD\u200a=\u200a0.20, 95%CI (-0.04, 0.43), P\u200a=\u200a0.099]. However, color vision with blue light-filtering IOLs was significantly reduced in the blue light spectrum under mesopic light conditions [SMD\u200a=\u200a0.74, 95%CI (0.29, 1.18), P\u200a=\u200a0.001]. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis demonstrates that postoperative visual performance with blue light-filtering IOLs is approximately equal to that of UV light-filtering IOLs after cataract surgery, but color vision with blue light-filtering IOLs demonstrated some compromise in the blue light spectrum under mesopic light conditions."}

SETTING: Keio University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. METHODS: In this prospective study, eyes having cataract surgery were divided into 4 groups based on IOL type: aspheric SN (AcrySof SN60WF), aspheric ZA (Tecnis ZA9003), aspheric PY (Hoya PY-60 AD), and spherical (AcrySof Natural SN60AT). Postoperative higher-order aberrations (HOAs) of the cornea and whole eye and the pupil diameter under photopic and mesopic conditions were measured. The HOA was calculated using the individual pupil diameter. The correlation between corneal and ocular spherical aberrations and pupil diameter was evaluated. RESULTS: Each group comprised 30 eyes. Ocular spherical aberrations were significantly lower than corneal spherical aberrations under mesopic conditions in the aspheric SN group, the aspheric ZA group, and the aspheric PY group (P<.05); there was no significant difference between the aberrations in the spherical group. Linear regression showed significant correlations between postoperative corneal and ocular spherical aberrations (beta = 0.39, aspheric SN; beta = 0.38, aspheric ZA; beta = 0.58, aspheric PY; beta = 0.79, spherical). The differences in corneal and ocular spherical aberrations were significantly correlated with pupil diameter in the aspheric IOL groups but not in the spherical IOL group. CONCLUSIONS: The amount of spherical aberration correction by aspheric IOLs varied depending on IOL type and individual pupil diameter. The linear regression equation in this study may make it possible to customize postoperative ocular spherical aberration after cataract surgery."}

SETTING: Beijing Tongren Eye Center, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University; Beijing Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences Key Laboratory, Beijing, China. DESIGN: Prospective comparative clinical study. METHODS: This study evaluated eyes that had implantation of 1 of the following 3 IOLs: photochromic Aurium Matrix acrylic, model 400; yellow AF-1 (UY); or clear MC611MI. All eyes were followed for 3 months. The uncorrected (UDVA) and corrected (CDVA) distance visual acuities, contrast vision (lighting 400 lux, 30 lux, 5 lux), contrast sensitivity, color vision (Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test under 400 lux, 30 lux), and patient questionnaire responses were evaluated. RESULTS: The photochromic IOL group comprised 39 eyes; the yellow IOL group, 41 eyes; and the clear IOL group, 38 eyes. There were no significant differences between the 3 IOLs in UDVA, CDVA, contrast sensitivity, or questionnaire responses. The photochromic group had significantly better color vision than the yellow IOL group at 30 lux and better contrast vision at 5% contrast (P < .05); however, there were no significant differences between the photochromic IOL group and the clear IOL group (P > .05). CONCLUSION: The photochromic blue light-filtering IOL performed as well as the yellow and clear IOLs under photopic conditions. Under mesopic conditions, the yellow IOL gave poor color vision and contrast sensitivity."}

A number of studies have shown a significant increase in FAZ size in conditions of vascular pathology including diabetes. A non-invasive method of estimating FAZ size may be a valuable addition to a psychophysical test battery. We used a blue-light field to reveal the activity of the retinal leucocytes to two groups of normal subjects with average ages 24 and 61 years. Two methods were used to estimate the FAZ size, making use of the fact that subjects could see their own FAZ as the area free of leucocyte activity. The first method required subjects to indicate when leucocyte activity stopped as the field size was decreased and when it reappeared as field size was increased. The second required subjects to match the size of the leucocyte-free area with a white circle superimposed on the field. A search algorithm was used to change circle size according to subjects' responses. Results show a significant difference in FAZ size between the two age groups with both methods of measurement, and estimates were comparable to those reported using angiographic methods."}

METHODS: Human RPE cells were exposed to blue light (wave length 470-490 nm); delta psi(m) was measured by rhodamine 123 staining and subsequent flow cytometry. Three groups were investigated: Group A (exposure to different intensity of blue light); group B (exposure to identical intensity for different duration); group C (exposure to identical intensity and duration, different prolongation of post-exposure culture). Cyt C activity was assayed by ELISA. Caspase-3 was detected by colorimetric assay. In these aspects, two groups were investigated: Group I [(2000+/-500) 1x for 6 h]; Group II [(2000+/-500) 1x for 12 h]. RESULTS: When human RPE cells were exposed to blue light, the more pronounced decrease of delta psi(m) was consistent with the increase of light intensity in group A. Pronounced decrease of delta psi(m) was seen at 6 h and 12 h of exposure duration in group B. At 6 h prolongation of post-exposure culture in group C, the decrease of delta psi(m) was observed, lasting 48 h. The concentration of Cyt C was detected; no significant changes were found at 6 h and 12 h prolongation of post-exposure culture, but a significant increase was found at 24 h and 36 h post-exposure in the two groups. The increase was more significant in Group II than in Group I at 24 h post-exposure. The activity change of caspase-3 was not found in the two groups. CONCLUSION: Blue light exposure over threshold can induce damage to human RPE cells, probably by triggering the mitochondrial permeability transition, which results in the decrease of delta psi(m) and the release of cytochrome C."}

Using RACE procedures, we obtained full-length cDNA sequences for three of these five groups. The deduced amino acid sequences include the photolyase-homologous domain in the N-terminal half, and they also contain a C-terminal extension of about 200 amino acids in length. These structural features indicate that the genes indeed encode Adiantum cryptochromes and represent a small gene family having at least three members."}

METHODS: It was a experimental study. A human retinal pigment epithelium cell line (ARPE-19) was used to study the protective role. Cells from the same passage were divided into the control, light exposure only, light exposure plus colorless IOL (FV-60A), light exposure plus photochromic IOL (BV-60A), light exposure plus yellow IOL (Acrysof Natural IOL) groups. The treatments were performed when the cells grew to 90% confluency. All cells were irradiated with visible light at an illumination intensity of 60 000-61 000 lux. After the treatments, we assessed 1: cells' viability by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay; 2: the extent of apoptosis by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), observing changes in the ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and performing Hoechst staining to measure the apoptosis index (AI); 3: examining vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) levels in the culture medium by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Measurements of the cell viability of the five groups were (0.61 \u00b1 0.01), (0.39 \u00b1 0.01), (0.46 \u00b1 0.01), (0.57 \u00b1 0.01), and (0.58 \u00b1 0.02), respectively. Apoptosis was significantly activated by visible light as observed in TUNEL staining and TEM. The AIs of the five groups were (0.99 \u00b1 0.65)%, (9.28 \u00b1 0.59)%, (6.54 \u00b1 0.37)%, (4.69 \u00b1 0.74)%, and (2.72 \u00b1 0.67)%, respectively. The levels of VEGF in the five groups were (3931.64 \u00b1 25.26) ng/L, (5459.38 \u00b1 42.69) ng/L, (4800.55 \u00b1 42.12) ng/L, (4561.21 \u00b1 46.27) ng/L, and (4420.35 \u00b1 28.66) ng/L, respectively. The levels of PEDF in the five groups were (182.85 \u00b1 1.68) \u00b5g/L, (156.52 \u00b1 0.64) \u00b5g/L, (155.57 \u00b1 3.43) \u00b5g/L, (167.57 \u00b1 2.88) \u00b5g/L, and (170.90 \u00b1 2.99) \u00b5g/L, respectively. Comparing the photochromic IOL group with the yellow IOL group, there was no difference in cell viability (q = 0.94) and PEDF levels (q = 1.51) (P > 0.05), but there was a significant difference between the AI (q = 5.04) and VEGF levels (q = 6.78) (P < 0.05). Comparing the photochromic IOL group with the colorless IOL group, there were significant differences in cell viability (q = 18.92) , AI (q = 4.78) , VEGF (q = 11.52) and PEDF levels (q = 4.96) (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Photochromic IOL can abate the degree of acute photodamage of RPE. The protective efficiency was the highest when using the yellow Acrysof Natural IOL, followed by photochromic IOL and colorless IOL."}

SETTING: Brasilia Ophthalmologic Hospital, Brasilia, and Sao Geraldo Eye Hospital, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil. METHODS: In an intraindividual randomized prospective study of 25 patients with bilateral cataract, an IOL with a modified posterior surface (AcrySof IQ) was compared with a biconvex IOL with spherical surfaces (AcrySof Natural, Alcon). Ocular aberrations with a 5.0 mm and 6.0 mm pupil were measured with a Hartmann-Shack aberrometer. Quality of vision was measured by visual acuity and contrast sensitivity under mesopic and photopic conditions. All patients were followed for 3 months. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between eyes in postoperative uncorrected and best corrected distance visual acuities after a follow-up of 1 month and 3 months. Postoperatively, there was a statistically significant between-group difference in contrast sensitivity under photopic conditions without glare at 18 cycles per degree (cpd) (P = .04) and under mesopic conditions without glare at all spatial frequencies (3 cpd, 6 cpd, 12 cpd, and 18 cpd; P = .03, P = .009, P = .003, and P = .003, respectively) and with glare at 3 cpd and 6 cpd (P = .001 and P = .02, respectively). The difference in higher-order aberration (HOA) values between groups was statistically significant with a 5.0 mm and 6.0 mm pupil, with the AcrySof IQ IOL inducing less HOA than the AcrySof Natural IOL. Eyes with an AcrySof IQ IOL also had statistically significant less spherical aberration than eyes with an AcrySof Natural IOL with both pupil diameters (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The AcrySof IQ IOL with a modified posterior surface induced significantly less HOA and spherical aberration than the AcrySof Natural IOL. Contrast sensitivity was better under mesopic conditions with the AcrySof IQ IOL."}

METHODS: Thirty patients were randomised to receive one of six lens implants including three aspheric lenses and their spherical counterparts. Pre and postoperative testing was carried out including visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and wavefront analysis. All patients were asked to fill in a visual function questionnaire (modification of cataract TyPE) to assess subjective differences in visual quality. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between groups for best-corrected visual acuity. Contrast sensitivity testing showed the Tecnis lens to perform better than the Cee-on Edge in all lighting conditions with significant differences at 3 and/or 6 cycles/degree in three out of four lighting conditions. No significant differences in contrast sensitivity were seen between the other lens pairs. All aspheric lenses showed less spherical aberration than their spherical pairs with statistical significance reached in two out of three pairs (the Ceeon Edge vs Tecnis, and Acrysof Natural vs IQ). The questionnaire revealed no evidence of improved subjective vision with the aspheric lenses compared to the spherical lenses. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study concurs with previously published trials in showing decreased spherical aberration and improved contrast sensitivity with aspheric lenses compared to spherical lenses. There was no evidence that the patients implanted with aspheric lenses rate their quality of vision higher than those implanted with spherical lenses. Study numbers were small and larger numbers may be required to demonstrate statistical differences in subjective data."}

There were nine patients (nine eyes) in the SN60 group and 10 patients (10 eyes) in the SA60 group. All patients were operated using phacoemulsification. Postoperative VA (Snellen chart), contrast sensitivity (Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity chart) and colour perception (Farnsworth-Munsell D-15 panel test) were measured at 1, 3 and 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS: Postoperative best corrected VA after 6 months was 20/20 or better in 89% of SN60 eyes and 100% of SA60 eyes. Postoperative contrast sensitivity scores improved significantly in both groups under both photopic and mesopic conditions. There were no statistically significant differences in contrast sensitivity scores between the SN60 and SA60 groups at any of the postoperative evaluation time-points.

However, inter- and motorneurons present in today's vertebrate brains are thought to derive from neurons that combined sensory, integration, and motor function. Consistently, sensory inter-motorneurons have been found in the simple nerve nets of cnidarians, animals at the base of the evolutionary lineage. We show that light-sensory motorneurons and light-sensory interneurons are also present in the brains of vertebrates, challenging the paradigm that information processing and output circuitry in the central brain is shielded from direct environmental influences. We investigated two groups of nonvisual photopigments, VAL- and TMT-Opsins, in zebrafish and medaka fish; two teleost species from distinct habitats separated by over 300 million years of evolution. TMT-Opsin subclasses are specifically expressed not only in hypothalamic and thalamic deep brain photoreceptors, but also in interneurons and motorneurons with no known photoreceptive function, such as the typeXIV interneurons of the fish optic tectum. We further show that TMT-Opsins and Encephalopsin render neuronal cells light-sensitive. TMT-Opsins preferentially respond to blue light relative to rhodopsin, with subclass-specific response kinetics. We discovered that tmt-opsins co-express with val-opsins, known green light receptors, in distinct inter- and motorneurons. Finally, we show by electrophysiological recordings on isolated adult tectal slices that interneurons in the position of typeXIV neurons respond to light. Our work supports \"sensory-inter-motorneurons\" as ancient units for brain evolution. It also reveals that vertebrate inter- and motorneurons are endowed with an evolutionarily ancient, complex light-sensory ability that could be used to detect changes in ambient light spectra, possibly providing the endogenous equivalent to an optogenetic machinery."}

This was a patient-masked, randomized crossover study conducted at 6 clinical sites in the United States between September 2013 and January 2014. One hundred fifty-four bilaterally pseudophakic patients were recruited. Photostress recovery time and glare disability thresholds were measured with clip-on blue-light-filtering and placebo (clear; no blue-light filtration) glasses worn over patients' habitual correction. Photostress recovery time was quantified as the time necessary to regain sight of a grating target after intense light exposure. Glare disability threshold was assessed as the intensity of a white-light annulus necessary to obscure a central target. The order of filter used and test eye were randomized across patients. Photostress recovery time and glare disability thresholds were significantly improved (both P < 0.0001) when patients used blue-light-filtering glasses compared with clear, nonfiltering glasses. Compared with a nonfiltering placebo, adding a clip-on blue-absorbing filter to the glasses of pseudophakic patients implanted with clear IOLs significantly increased their ability to cope with glare and to recover normal viewing after an intensive photostress. This result implies that IOL designs with blue-light-filtering characteristics may be beneficial under intense light conditions."}

Test subjects were patients with bilateral visual loss and optic atrophy from either hereditary optic neuropathy (n\u2009=\u200911) or glaucoma (n\u2009=\u200911). We measured melatonin suppression, subjective sleepiness and cognitive functions in response to bright light exposure in the evening. We also quantified the post-illumination pupil response to a blue light stimulus. All results were compared to age-matched controls (n\u2009=\u200922). Both groups of patients showed similar melatonin suppression when compared to their controls. Greater melatonin suppression was intra-individually correlated to larger post-illumination pupil response in patients and controls. Only the glaucoma patients demonstrated a relative attenuation of their pupil response. In addition, they were sleepier with slower reaction times during nocturnal light exposure. In conclusion, glaucomatous, but not hereditary, optic neuropathy is associated with reduced acute light effects. At mild to moderate stages of disease, this is detected only in the pupil function and not in responses conveyed via the retinohypothalamic tract such as melatonin suppression."}

METHODS: 80 eyes of 40 patients with age-related cataract were enrolled in this study. Each patient received a 1-piece MICS IOL (AF-1 NY-60, Hoya, Tokyo, Japan) in one eye and a 3-piece MICS IOL (AF-1 iMICS Y-60H, Tokyo, Hoya) in the other eye. At the 1-year follow-up, the patients were examined at the slit lamp, visual acuity was determined and standardised high-resolution digital retroillumination images were taken for objective quantification of regeneratory PCO using an automated image analysis software (AQUA). RESULTS: The mean regeneratory PCO score (1-piece IOL: 0.2, 3-piece IOL 0.3, p=0.7) and the neodymium:yttrium-aluminium-garnet laser capsulotomy rate (two cases in 3-piece IOL group; p=0.5) were comparable low for both IOLs. Capsular folds occurred significantly more often in the 3-piece IOL group (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Modification of the MICS IOL from a 3-piece to a 1-piece haptic design caused in short term no significant change in PCO amount. Compared with the 3-piece IOL, the 1-piece IOL led to significantly less capsular folds 1 year after surgery."}

{"docid": 23211814, "title": "Glare disability, photostress recovery, and chromatic contrast: relation to macular pigment and serum lutein and zeaxanthin.", "text": "PURPOSE: A large body of research has linked macular lutein and zeaxanthin to reduced risk of degenerative eye disease. The earliest published hypothesis for the role of the pigments was not based on chronic protection but immediate function. Recent data on macular pigment (MP) have shown that screening the foveal cones from short-wave light does, in fact, result in improvements in photostress recovery (PR), glare disability (GD), and chromatic contrast (CC). This study examined those relations on a larger sample. METHODS: A total of 150 young healthy subjects were assessed. Plasma samples were obtained from 100 subjects for HPLC quantification of serum xanthophylls. MP density was measured using customized heterochromatic flicker photometery. GD, PR, and CC were measured in Maxwellian view using a broadband xenon light source. GD was measured by increasing the intensity of an annulus until it veiled a central target. PR was measured as the time necessary to regain sight of a central target after a 5-second exposure to an intense bleaching light. CC was measured as the amount of light necessary in a 460-nm background to lose sight of a central target. RESULTS: MP density was significantly related to serum lutein and zeaxanthin combined (r = 0.31, P = 0.002), GD (r = 0.24, P = 0.0015), PR (r = -0.18, P = 0.01), and CC (r = 0.46, P = 0.00005). CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm earlier reports of a significant relation between variation in macular pigment optical density and immediate effects on visual function. As with many species, intraocular yellow filters in humans appear to improve many aspects of the visual stimulus. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00909090.)."}

METHODS: This study evaluated eyes that had implantation of an Acrysof IQ SN60WF yellow-tinted IOL or an Acrysof SA60AT clear IOL. All eyes were evaluated postoperatively at 1 month and 3 months. The uncorrected distance visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and color vision (Ishihara pseudoisochromatic test, Edridge-Green lantern test, Heidelberg anomaloscope, and Farnsworth-Munsell (FM) 100-hue test) were evaluated. RESULTS: Both IOL groups comprised 50 eyes. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in color vision on any of the 4 tests (P\u2265.05). Plotting the error scores on the polarity graph of the FM 100-hue test showed that eyes with a yellow-tinted IOL did not have a specific axis of confusion. CONCLUSION: There was no difference in color perception between the 2 IOLs irrespective of the color vision test used."}
{"docid": 25223707, "title": "Autofluorescence imaging of macular pigment: influence and correction of ocular media opacities.", "text": "The healthy adult human retina contains in its macular region a high concentration of blue-light absorbing carotenoid compounds, known as macular pigment (MP). Consisting of the carotenoids lutein, zeaxanthin, and meso-zeaxanthin, the MP is thought to shield the vulnerable tissue layers in the retina from lightinduced damage through its function as an optical attenuator and to protect the tissue cells within its immediate vicinity through its function as a potent antioxidant. Autofluorescence imaging (AFI) is emerging as a viable optical method for MP screening of large subject populations, for tracking of MP changes over time, and for monitoring MP uptake in response to dietary supplementation. To investigate the influence of ocular media opacities on AFI-based MP measurements, in particular, the influence of lens cataracts, we conducted a clinical trial with a large subject population (93 subjects) measured before and after cataract surgery. General AFI image contrast, retinal blood vessel contrast, and presurgery lens opacity scores [Lens Opacities Classification System III (LOCS III)] were investigated as potential predictors for image degradation. These clinical results show that lens cataracts can severely degrade the achievable pixel contrasts in the AFI images, which results in nominal MP optical density levels that are artifactually reduced. While LOCS III scores and blood vessel contrast are found to be only a weak predictor for this effect, a strong correlation exists between the reduction factor and the image contrast, which can be quantified via pixel intensity histogram parameters. Choosing the base width of the histogram, the presence or absence of ocular media opacities can be determined and, if needed, the nominal MP levels can be corrected with factors depending on the strength of the opacity."}

CLINICAL NEED: TARGET POPULATION AND CONDITION A cataract is a hardening and clouding of the normally transparent crystalline lens that may result in a progressive loss of vision depending on its size, location and density. The condition is typically bilateral, seriously compromises visual acuity and contrast sensitivity and increases glare. Cataracts can also affect people at any age, however, they usually occur as a part of the natural aging process. The occurrence of cataracts increases with age from about 12% at age 50 years, to 60% at age 70. In general, approximately 50% of people 65 year of age or older have cataracts. Mild cataracts can be treated with a change in prescription glasses, while more serious symptoms are treated by surgical removal of the cataract and implantation of an IOL. In Ontario, the estimated prevalence of cataracts increased from 697,000 in 1992 to 947,000 in 2004 (35.9% increase, 2.4% annual increase). The number of cataract surgeries per 1,000 individuals at risk of cataract increased from 64.6 in 1992 to 140.4 in 1997 (61.9% increase, 10.1% annual increase) and continued to steadily increase to 115.7 in 2004 (10.7% increase, 5.2% increase per year). DESCRIPTION OF TECHNOLOGY/THERAPY: IOLs are classified either as monofocal, multifocal, or accommodative. Traditionally, monofocal (i.e.. fixed focusing power) IOLs are available as replacement lenses but their implantation can cause a loss of the eye's accommodative capability (which allows variable focusing). Patients thus usually require eyeglasses after surgery for reading and near vision tasks. Multifocal IOLs aim to improve near and distant vision and obviate the need for glasses. Potential disadvantages include reduced contrast sensitivity, halos around lights and glare. Accommodating IOLs are designed to move with ciliary body contraction during accommodation and, therefore, offer a continuous range of vision (i.e. near, intermediate and distant vision) without the need for glasses. Purported advantages over multifocal IOLs include the avoidance of haloes and no reduction in contrast sensitivity. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) was the first material used in the fabrication of IOLs and has inherent ultraviolet blocking abilities. PMMA IOLs are inflexible, however, and require a larger incision for implantation compared with newer foldable silicone (hydrophobic) and acrylic (hydrophobic or hydrophilic) lenses. IOLs can be further sub-classified as being either aspheric or spheric, blue/violet filtered or non-filtered or 1- or 3-piece. METHODS OF EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS: A literature search was conducted from January 2003 to January 2009 that included OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), The Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment/Centre for Review and Dissemination. Inclusion CriteriaExclusion Criteriaadult patients with age-related cataractssystematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) PRIMARY OUTCOMES: distance visual acuity (best corrected distance visual acuity), near visual acuity (best distance corrected near visual acuity) SECONDARY OUTCOMES: contrast sensitivity, depth of field, glare, quality of life, visual function, spectacle dependence, posterior capsule opacification.studies with fewer than 20 eyesIOLs for non-age related cataractsIOLs for presbyopiastudies with a mean follow-up <6monthsstudies reporting insufficient data for analysis COMPARISONS OF INTEREST: The primary comparison of interest was accommodative vs. multifocal vs. monofocal lenses. Secondary comparisons of interest included: tinted vs. non-tinted lensesaspheric vs. spheric lensesmultipiece vs. single piece lensesbiomaterial A (e.g. acrylic) vs. biomaterial B (e.g. silicone) lensessharp vs. round edged lensesThe quality of the studies was examined according to the GRADE Working Group criteria for grading quality of evidence for interventional procedures. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: The conclusions of the systematic review of IOLs for age-related cataracts are summarized in Executive Summary Table 1. CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE ONTARIO HEALTH SYSTEM: Procedures for crystalline lens removal and IOL insertion are insured and listed in the Ontario Schedule of Benefits.If a particular lens is determined to be medically necessary for a patient, the cost of the lens is covered by the hospital budget. If the patient chooses a lens that has enhanced features, then the hospital may choose to charge an additional amount above the cost of the usual lens offered.An IOL manufacturer stated that monofocal lenses comprise approximately 95% of IOL sales in Ontario and premium lenses (e.g., multifocal/accomodative) consist of about 5% of IOL sales.A medical consultant stated that all types of lenses are currently being used in Ontario (e.g., multifocal, monofocal, accommodative, tinted, nontinted, spheric, and aspheric). Nonfoldable lenses, rarely used in routine cases, are primarily used for complicated cataract implantation situations.ES Table 1:Conclusions for the Systematic Review of IOLs for Age-Related CataractsComparisonConclusionGRADE QualityMultifocal vs. monofocalObjective OutcomesSignificant improvement in BDCUNVANo significant difference in BCDVAInconclusive evidence for contrast sensitivityInconclusive evidence for glareSubjective OutcomesInconclusive evidence for visual satisfactionSignificant increase in glare/halosSignificant increase in freedom from spectaclesmoderatemoderatelowvery lowlowlow/moderatelow/moderateAccommodative vs. multifocal/monofocalInconclusive due to Insufficient limited evidence for any effectiveness outcomevery lowHydrophilic acrylic vs. other materials (hydrophobic acrylic, silicone)Significant increase in PCO scoreLowSharp edged compared to round edgedSignificant reduction in PCO scoreLowOne piece compared to three pieceNo significant difference in PCO scorelowHydrophobic acrylic compared to siliconeNo significant difference in PCO scoremoderateAspherical modified prolate anterior surface compared to sphericalNo significant difference in VASignificant reduction in contrast sensitivityvery lowvery lowBlue light filtering compared to non blue-light filteringNo significant difference in BCDVANo significant difference in contrast sensitivityNo significant difference in HRQLlowlowhigh/moderateBCDVA refers to best corrected distance visual acuity; BDCUNVA, best distance corrected unaided near visual acuity; HRQL, health related quality of life; PCO, posterior capsule opacification; VA, visual acuity."}

METHODS: Total, corneal, and internal SA were measured using iTrace at a 6-mm pupil size in 27 eyes of 27 patients implanted with a monofocal spherical IOL (group 1: Natural, SN60AT), 30 eyes of 30 patients implanted with a monofocal aspheric IOL (group 2: IQ, SN60WF), and 30 eyes of 30 patients implanted with a multifocal aspheric IOL (group 3: ReSTOR, SN6AD1) at 3 months after cataract surgery. We compared the internal SAs of these IOLs in pupil sizes of 3, 4, 5, and 6 mm. RESULTS: There were no demographic statistically significant differences among the groups. The internal SA of group 1 had a positive value. The internal SA of group 2 was -0.175 \u00b1 0.135 \u03bcm in 5-mm pupils and -0.227 \u00b1 0.253 \u03bcm in 6-mm pupils.

CONCLUSION: Measuring internal SA with iTrace yields relatively accurate results in all types of IOLs with adequate pupil sizes."}

This was a prospective randomized study of 98 patients with senile cataract for a period of 6\u00a0months from day 1 of August 2014 to day 31 of January 2015. After phacoemulsification, 33 patients were implanted with clear IOLs (AcrySof UV-filtering IOL, SA60AT), 32 patients were implanted with yellow coloured IOLs (AcrySof Natural blue-light-attenuating and UV-filtering IOL, SN60AT with IMPRUV(\u00ae) filter) and 33 patients were implanted with orange-tinted blue-filtering IOLs (PC440Y Optech). After 1\u00a0month, monocular CSF was done under photopic (85\u00a0cd/m(2)) and mesopic (3\u00a0cd/m(2)) illumination condition with CSV-1000 test.

Phot1, a member of this family, contains two FMN-binding domains, LOV1 and LOV2, within the N-terminal region and a C-terminal serine-threonine protein kinase domain. Light irradiation of oat phot1 LOV2 produces a cysteinyl adduct (Cys-39) at the flavin C(4a) position, which decays thermally back to the dark state. We measured pH and isotope effects on the photocycle. Between pH 3.7 and 9.5, adduct formation showed minimal pH dependence, and adduct decay showed only slight pH dependence, indicating that the pK values of mechanistically relevant groups are outside this range. LOV2 showed a nearly 5-fold slowing of adduct formation in D(2)O relative to H(2)O, indicating that the rate-limiting step involves proton transfer(s). Light-induced changes in the far UV CD spectrum of LOV2 revealed putative protein structural perturbations. The light minus dark CD difference spectrum resembles an inverted alpha-helix spectrum, suggesting that alpha-helicity is reversibly lost upon light irradiation. Decay kinetics for CD spectral changes in the far UV region occur at the same rate as those in the visible region, indicating synchronous relaxation of protein and chromophore structures."}

{"docid": 26708928, "title": "Protective Effect of Fucoxanthin Isolated from Laminaria japonica against Visible Light-Induced Retinal Damage Both in Vitro and in Vivo.", "text": "With increasingly serious eye exposure to light stresses, such as light-emitting diodes, computers, and widescreen mobile phones, efficient natural compounds for preventing visible light-induced retinal damages are becoming compelling needs in the modern society. Fucoxanthin, as the main light absorption system in marine algae, may possess an outstanding bioactivity in vision protection because of its filtration of blue light and excellent antioxidative activity. In this work, both in vitro and in vivo simulated visible light-induced retinal damage models were employed. The in vitro results revealed that fucoxanthin exhibited better bioactivities than lutein, zeaxanthin, and blueberry anthocyanins in inhibiting overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor, resisting senescence, improving phagocytic function, and clearing intracellular reactive oxygen species in retinal pigment epithelium cells. The in vivo experiment also confirmed the superiority of fucoxanthin than lutein in protecting retina against photoinduced damage. This excellent bioactivity may be attributed to its unique structural features, including allenic, epoxide, and acetyl groups. Fucoxanthin is expected to be an important ocular nutrient in the future."}
{"docid": 22653894, "title": "Does pupil constriction under blue and green monochromatic light exposure change with age?", "text": "Many nonvisual functions are regulated by light through a photoreceptive system involving melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells that are maximally sensitive to blue light. Several studies have suggested that the ability of light to modulate circadian entrainment and to induce acute effects on melatonin secretion, subjective alertness, and gene expression decreases during aging, particularly for blue light. This could contribute to the documented changes in sleep and circadian regulatory processes with aging. However, age-related modification in the impact of light on steady-state pupil constriction, which regulates the amount of light reaching the retina, is not demonstrated. We measured pupil size in 16 young (22.8\u00b14 years) and 14 older (61\u00b14.4 years) healthy subjects during 45-second exposures to blue (480 nm) and green (550 nm) monochromatic lights at low (7\u00d710(12) photons/cm2/s), medium (3\u00d710(13) photons/cm2/s), and high (10(14) photons/cm2/s) irradiance levels. Results showed that young subjects had consistently larger pupils than older subjects for dark adaptation and during all light exposures. Steady-state pupil constriction was greater under blue than green light exposure in both age groups and increased with increasing irradiance. Surprisingly, when expressed in relation to baseline pupil size, no significant age-related differences were observed in pupil constriction. The observed reduction in pupil size in older individuals, both in darkness and during light exposure, may reduce retinal illumination and consequently affect nonvisual responses to light. The absence of a significant difference between age groups for relative steady-state pupil constriction suggests that other factors such as tonic, sympathetic control of pupil dilation, rather than light sensitivity per se, account for the observed age difference in pupil size regulation. Compared to other nonvisual functions, the light sensitivity of steady-state pupil constriction appears to remain relatively intact and is not profoundly altered by age."}

Circadian misalignment is associated with the increased risk of sleep disturbance, obesity, diabetes mellitus, depression, ischaemic heart disease, stroke and cancer. Meanwhile, blue light causes photochemical damage to the retina, and may be associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). At present, clear intraocular lenses (IOLs) and blue-blocking IOLs are both widely used for cataract surgery; there is currently a lack of randomised controlled trials to determine whether clear or blue-blocking IOLs should be used. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This randomised controlled trial will recruit 1000 cataract patients and randomly allocate them to receive clear IOLs or blue-blocking IOLs in a ratio of 1:1. The primary outcomes are mortality and the incidence of cardiovascular disease, cancer and AMD. Secondary outcomes are fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, glycated haemoglobin, sleep quality, daytime sleepiness depressive symptoms, light sensitivity, the circadian rhythm of physical activity, wrist skin temperature and urinary melatonin metabolite. Primary outcomes will be followed until 20\u2005years after surgery, and secondary outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 1\u2005year after surgery. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from the Institutional Review Board of Nara Medical University (No. 13-032).

{"docid": 21886359, "title": "Sleep disturbances are related to decreased transmission of blue light to the retina caused by lens yellowing.", "text": "STUDY OBJECTIVES: Sleep pattern and circadian rhythms are regulated via the retinohypothalamic tract in response to stimulation of a subset of retinal ganglion cells, predominantly by blue light (450-490 nm). With age, the transmission of blue light to the retina is reduced because of the aging process of the human lens, and this may impair the photoentrainment of circadian rhythm leading to sleep disorders. The aim of the study was to examine the association between lens aging and sleep disorders. DESIGN: Cross-sectional population based study. SETTING: The study was performed at the Research Center for Prevention and Health, Glostrup Hospital, Denmark and at the Department of Ophthalmology, Herlev Hospital, Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: An age- and sex-stratified sample of 970 persons aged 30 to 60 years of age drawn from a sample randomly selected from the background population. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep disturbances were evaluated by a combination of questionnaire and the use of prescription sleeping medication. Lens aging (transmission and yellowing) was measured objectively by lens autofluorometry. The risk of sleep disturbances was significantly increased when the transmission of blue light to the retina was low, even after correction for the effect of age and other confounding factors such as smoking habits, diabetes mellitus, gender, and the risk of ischemic heart disease (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Filtration of blue light by the aging lens was significantly associated with an increased risk of sleep disturbances. We propose that this is a result of disturbance of photoentrainment of circadian rhythms."}

Postoperatively, 100% and 9% logMAR corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) were assessed. Retroillumination photographs were analyzed using the posterior capsule opacity software system. The data on PCO scores were compared with those of a conventional spherical hydrophobic IOL (Acrysof SN60AT). RESULTS: One hundred percent CDVA was significantly better at 12 months and 9% CDVA was better at 6, 12, and 24 months (P<.05) with the negatively aspheric IOL. One eye in each group with microincision IOLs developed capsule phimosis at 1 month.

At 24 months, the mean PCO score remained less than 10% with the conventional spherical IOL, whereas it increased with time in the negatively aspheric IOL (up to 16%) and the aspherically neutral IOL (up to 23%). CONCLUSIONS: The negatively aspheric IOL had a better PCO profile than the aspherically neutral IOL. This may be attributed to the difference in the edge design between the IOLs.

For contrast sensitivity, these differences reached statistical significance under photopic conditions at two spatial frequencies (3 cycles per degree (cpd), 6 cpd, 12 cpd, and 18 cpd; p =0.022, p =0.017, p = 0.065, and p=0.191, respectively) and under mesopic conditions at three spatial frequencies (3 cpd, 6 cpd, 12 cpd, and 18 cpd; p =0.007, p =0.033, p =0.030, and p =0.080, respectively). Eyes with AcrySof IQ also had statistically significant less spherical aberration than eyes with AcrySof Natural (p<0.001). Sensitivity analysis showed that the results were relatively stable and reliable. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The overall findings indicate that AcrySof IQ with a modified aspheric surface induced significantly less spherical aberration than AcrySof Natural. Contrast sensitivity in eyes with AcrySof IQ is better than that in eyes with AcrySof Natural, especially under mesopic conditions."}

METHODS: 74 patients scheduled for bilateral cataract surgery underwent implantation of either yellow IOLs (HOYA YA60BB) or non-tinted IOLs (VA60BB) in both eyes. Contrast visual acuity with and without a glare source was measured under photopic (100 cd/m2) and mesopic (slightly higher luminance than typically used-5 cd/m2) conditions at 2 weeks and 3 months after surgery using the contrast sensitivity accurate tester. Visual acuity and the incidence of patients who noted cyanopsia were also examined. RESULTS: No significant differences between the yellow tinted and non-tinted IOL groups were observed in mean visual acuity or in photopic or higher luminance mesopic contrast visual acuity with and without glare source at either 2 weeks or 3 months after surgery. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in contrast visual acuity loss as a result of glare. The incidence of patients who noticed cyanopsia was significantly less in the yellow tinted IOL group than in the non-tinted IOL group at 2 weeks after surgery (p = 0.0234), but no patients reported cyanopsia at 3 months. CONCLUSION: Visual function in patients with yellow tinted IOLs is virtually the same as that in patients with non-tinted IOLs."}

SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Dokkyo Medical University, Tochigi, Japan. DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: Eyes having phacoemulsification were randomly assigned to have implantation of 1 of 3 hydrophobic acrylic IOL models. The IOLs were photographed at 0 degree and 90 degrees 1 week, 6 months, and 1 year after implantation using a Nidek EAS-1000 anterior chamber analyzer in slit mode. The images were used to determine the intensity of light scattering in the surface and middle regions of the IOL optic. RESULTS: The study comprised 65 eyes of 57 patients with a mean age of 72.5 years. The rate of increase in light-scattering intensity was similar in the middle and surface regions of the Tecnis ZA9003 aspheric IOL. The increase in light-scattering intensity in both regions of the AF-1 VA-60BB spherical IOL was greater than that in the aspheric IOL at all the measurement points. The intensity of light scattering was highest and tended to increase over time in both regions of the AcrySof SA60AT spherical IOL; the rate of increase in intensity was higher in the surface region than in the middle region, and the difference was significantly greater at 6 months and 1 year than at 1 week. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that AcrySof SA60AT and AF-1 VA-60BB IOLs are likely to develop glistenings over time and that the former may develop whitening."}

METHOD: Prospective, randomized, double-masked study that 260 eyes of patients who underwent cataract extraction and IOL implantation was performed. Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: AcrySof IQ or AcrySof Natural. One week, one and three month postoperative evaluations included contrast sensitivity and wavefront analysis. The independent-samples T test was used. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULT: The AcrySof IQ group has significantly higher and middle spatial frequency of contrast sensitivity. The difference in low spatial frequency was getting significant along with time. Patients with AcrySof IQ had a reduction in total high-order aberrations and spherical aberration. There were no difference in coma between two groups. CONCLUSION: The use of aspheric acrylic AcrySof IQ IOL may improve the quality of vision as a result of the reduction of contrast sensitivity and spherical aberration."}

METHOD: Using a prospective clinical trial design, we examined the null hypothesis that coloured light filter overlays do not improve reading rates in AMD when compared to a clear filter. Reading rates for 12 subjects with non-exudative AMD, associated with a relative scotoma and central fixation (mean age 81 years, SD 5.07 years) were determined using the Rate of Reading Test (printed, nonsense, lower case sans serif, stationary text) with 10 different, coloured light filter overlays (Intuitive Overlays); figures in brackets are percentage transmission values); rose (78%), pink (78%), purple (67%), aqua (81%), blue (74%), lime-green (86%), mint-green (85%), yellow (93%), orange (83%) and grey (71%). A clear overlay (Roscolene # 00) (360 cdm-2) with 100% transmittance was used as a control. RESULTS: Anova indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in reading rates with the coloured light filter overlays compared to the clear filter. Furthermore, chi-squared analysis indicated that the rose, purple and blue filters had a significantly poorer overall ranking in terms of reading rates compared to the other coloured and clear light filters. CONCLUSION: Coloured light filter overlays are unlikely to provide a clinically significant improvement in reading rates for people with non-exudative AMD associated with a relative scotoma and central fixation."}
{"docid": 24970263, "title": "Impact of cataract surgery on sleep in patients receiving either ultraviolet-blocking or blue-filtering intraocular lens implants.", "text": "PURPOSE: Although visual impairment is a well-recognized consequence of cataract development, little is known about the ability of the melanopsin-based photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs) to regulate sleep-wake timing in the presence of cataract. In this study, we replaced a cataractous natural crystalline lens with two different types of artificial intraocular lenses, a UV-blocking lens or a blue-filtering lens. We investigated the level of sleep disturbance before cataract surgery and any change in sleep due to improved light transmission following surgery and compared this in both types of intraocular lens. METHODS: Quality of sleep in 961 patients undergoing cataract surgery was assessed by administering the validated self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. The PSQI distinguishes good sleepers from poor sleepers by scoring seven different sleep components over the last month, which are combined to produce an overall score for sleep quality. Patients received either an ultraviolet-blocking (UVB) clear intraocular lens (IOL) or a blue-filtering (BF) IOL. Questionnaires were completed four times: 1 month preoperatively and again 1, 6 (UVB-IOL only), and 12 months postoperatively. RESULTS: Half of the patients reported poor sleep in the presence of cataract in both the UVB-IOL (mean PSQI = 6.35; SD = 3.82) and BF-IOL (mean PSQI = 6.39; SD = 4.04) groups. Cataract removal improved overall sleep quality significantly 1 month postoperatively in the UVB-IOL (mean PSQI = 5.89; SD = 3.71) and BF-IOL (mean PSQI = 6.08; SD = 3.88) groups. Sleep latency also improved for the UVB-IOL (preoperative mean = 1.16; SD = 1.003) and BF-IOL (preoperative mean = 1.17; SD = 1.03) groups at 1 month (UVB-IOL group mean = 1.01; SD = 0.923 and BF-IOL group mean = 1.00; SD = 0.95), which was sustained at 6 months for the UVB-IOL group (mean = 1.02; SD = 0.93) and 12 months for both the UVB-IOL and BF-IOL groups (6 months: UVB-IOL group mean = 0.96; SD = 0.92 and for the BF-IOL group mean = 0.99; SD = 0.96). CONCLUSIONS: Overall sleep quality and sleep latency improves after removal of cataract irrespective of the type of IOL implanted. These data show that implantation of BF-IOL does not have a negative impact on the sleep-wake cycle."}
{"docid": 24597610, "title": "Effects of a chronic reduction of short-wavelength light input on melatonin and sleep patterns in humans: evidence for adaptation.", "text": "Light is an important environmental stimulus for the entrainment of the circadian clock and for increasing alertness. The intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells in the retina play an important role in transferring this light information to the circadian system and they are elicited in particular by short-wavelength light. Exposure to short wavelengths is reduced, for instance, in elderly people due to yellowing of the ocular lenses. This reduction may be involved in the disrupted circadian rhythms observed in aged subjects. Here, we tested the effects of reduced blue light exposure in young healthy subjects (n\u2009=\u200915) by using soft orange contact lenses (SOCL). We showed (as expected) that a reduction in the melatonin suppressing effect of light is observed when subjects wear the SOCL. However, after chronic exposure to reduced (short wavelength) light for two consecutive weeks we observed an increase in sensitivity of the melatonin suppression response. The response normalized as if it took place under a polychromatic light pulse. No differences were found in the dim light melatonin onset or in the amplitude of the melatonin rhythms after chronic reduced blue light exposure. The effects on sleep parameters were limited. Our results demonstrate that the non-visual light system of healthy young subjects is capable of adapting to changes in the spectral composition of environmental light exposure. The present results emphasize the importance of considering not only the short-term effects of changes in environmental light characteristics."}

SETTING: Service d'Ophtalmologie, Centre Hospitalier et Universitaire Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: This study included 111 eyes of 74 patients (age range 33 to 86 years). All cases had cataract surgery with Acrysof SN60WF monofocal IOL implantation and had a routine postoperative examination between March 2011 and June 2011. The incidence and severity of glistenings were evaluated with the slitlamp. Also evaluated was their relationship with age, sex, follow-up length, IOL power, and CDVA. Glistenings were subjectively graded (0 = absent; 1 = moderate; 2 = dense). RESULTS: Glistenings occurred in 96 eyes (86.5%). Glistenings were of grade 1 severity in 45 eyes (40.5%) and of grade 2 severity in 51 eyes (45.9%). The follow-up was significantly longer in eyes with grade 2 glistenings (P \u2264 .01). A limited, but significant, correlation was found between glistening severity and length of follow-up (r = 0.32, P<.01). Although there was a trend toward decreased visual acuities at higher glistening grades (r = 0.22, P = .01), there were no significant differences in CDVA between the glistening severity groups (P = .14). CONCLUSIONS: Glistenings were common in eyes with the blue light-filtering hydrophobic acrylic IOL and increased over time.

METHODS: A prospective controlled randomized double-masked analysis of 30 consecutive patients with CPRG defect and bilateral cataracts received a Natural IOL (test group) in 1 eye and a single-piece AcrySof IOL (control group) in the other eye. Patients were tested unilaterally to detect CPRG defect using Ishihara pseudoisochromatic plates and the Farnsworth D-15 test. Plates 1 to 21 measured the Ishihara error score; plates 22 to 25 indicated severity of defect based on clarity of both numerals as partial mild/moderate (both visible), partial severe defect (only 1 visible). The D-15 test is based on number of diametrical crossings on the circular diagram; severity is graded as mild (1 crossing), moderate (2 crossings), or severe (>2 crossings). Tests were performed before and after IOL implantation at 1, 3, and 6 months. At mean follow-up of 6.13 months +/- 1.2 (SD), analysis of variance test judged the difference in error scores and cross tabulation represented change in number of diametrical crossings. RESULTS: The mean age was 62.3 +/- 8.5 years. All patients were men. Before IOL implantation, all patients had moderate CPRG defect on both tests. The Ishihara error score in the test and control groups did not reveal statistically significant differences (P = .505 and P = .119, respectively). With D-15, none of the patients in the test or control group showed >2 crossings. CONCLUSION: The implantation of AcrySof Natural IOL did not worsen the preexisting severity of color defect in CPRG individuals."}

It was found that the PMMA used for IOL manufacturing can be tinted by dry exposure to mercury near-UV emitting lamp (emission maximum, 365 nm, light bandwidth +/- 140 nm; irradiance of 50-100 W/sq m as measured at the PMMA surface; time of exposure 70-100 h, room temperature). The UV irradiated samples were stored in the atmosphere of N2 under the heating-protected and clean conditions. The IOL sample holder allowed to remove IOL loops and their fixation areas from the zone of the passing light. The absorptive properties of IOLs treated with UV light were similar to those of young human lenses. Raman vibration and fluorescence spectral analyses of IOLs have shown that the yellow colour and its intensity in the irradiated samples depends on the presence of conjugated C = C and C = O groups (pi-pi conjugation) in the chemical composition of PMMA. When the PMMA samples were exposed for 70 h to a high level of UV radiation (50-100 W/sq m) no damage was seen with scanning electron microscopy at both side surfaces of the IOLs. The PMMA water exhaustive extracts made by 70 h of UV radiation exposure did not show any cytological damage when injected into the cell cultures of fibroblasts. The threshold for optical breakdown in PMMA was detected by 100 h of UV radiation at the level of exposure equivalent to at least 20,000 times levels for expected ambient UV exposure to PMMA within the eye. A rigorous quality index defined as the ratio of the line C = C/C = O stretching mode intensities was introduced for the UV-absorbing PMMA photostability. The findings suggest an applicability of the photochemical tinting and further research to test the efficacy and safety of UV-absorbing chromophore induction in the PMMA IOLs."}

METHODS: Reading speed was determined for 12 subjects with normal vision and 12 subjects with non-exudative AMD using stationary lowercase nonsensical print in Times Roman font and four light filters; a yellow Corning Photochromic Filter (CPF) 450, a grey neural density (ND) filter, an individual filter obtained using the Intuitive Colorimeter and a clear filter. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant light filter effect on reading speed for the normal subjects. The AMD group demonstrated a statistically significant 5% average improvement in reading speed with the CPF450 compared with the other filters although some AMD subjects had improvements of 10-15%. CONCLUSIONS: Light filters obtained using the Intuitive Colorimeter(R) performed poorly when compared with the CPF450, ND and clear filters for both the study groups. For the AMD group, average reading speed was statistically greater with the CPF450 than the other filters, however it is questionable whether the improvement (5%) would be clinically significant. As some of the subjects with AMD had greater improvements with the CPF450 we advocate clinical assessment of light filters using existing protocols on an individual basis."}

Twenty-seven patients had a blue light-filtering IOL implanted during vitrectomy for macular diseases (macular disease group), and 40 patients without macular disease had the same type of IOL implanted (non-macular disease group). The postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was\u00a0\u2265\u00a016/20 in all patients. The Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test was used to determine total error scores (TES) and mean error scores under photopic and mesopic conditions in both groups. The TES under mesopic conditions was significantly higher than that under photopic conditions in both groups (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). However, the TES in the macular disease group was not significantly different from that of the non-macular disease group under both photopic and mesopic conditions. The mean error scores under photopic conditions for hues 11, 14, 16, 17, 18, and 20 (yellowish-red to yellow) were significantly higher in the macular disease group than in the non-macular disease group. The mean error scores for hues 7 and 85 (red) were significantly higher in the non-macular disease group than in the macular disease group. Under mesopic conditions, the mean error scores for hues 30, 60, and 61 were significantly higher in the non-macular disease group than in the macular disease group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Our results indicate that blue light-filtering IOLs do not alter color discrimination in eyes with macular diseases, and these patients had good postoperative BCVA even under mesopic conditions."}
{"docid": 21094670, "title": "Impact of blue vs red light on retinal response of patients with seasonal affective disorder and healthy controls.", "text": "OBJECTIVES: Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is characterized by a mood lowering in autumn and/or winter followed by spontaneous remission in spring or summer. Bright light (BL) is recognized as the treatment of choice for individuals affected with this disease. It was speculated that BL acts on photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, particularly sensitive to blue light, which led to the emergence of apparatus enriched with blue light. However, blue light is more at risk to cause retinal damage. In addition, we reported using electroretinography (ERG) that a 60 min exposure of BL could reduce rod sensitivity. The goal of the present study was to verify if this decreased in sensitivity could be a consequence of the blue light portion present in the white light therapy lamps. We also wanted to assess the effect of monochromatic blue light vs red light in both healthy controls and patients with SAD. METHOD: 10 healthy subjects and 10 patients with SAD were exposed in a random order for 60 min to two different light colors (red or blue) separated by an interval of at least 1 day. Cone and rod ERG luminance-response function was assessed after light exposure. RESULTS: A two-way ANOVA indicates that blue light decreases the maximal ERG response (Vmax) in both groups in photopic (p<0.05) and scotopic conditions (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: The main finding of this experiment is that blue light reduces photoreceptor responses after only a single administration. This brings important concerns with regard to blue-enriched light therapy lamps used to treat SAD symptoms and other disorders."}

Recessive mutants in one allelic group are characterized by retarded hook opening, increased hypocotyl elongation and reduced hypocotyl chlorophyll content under white light (WL). These mutants showed a specific impairment in response to blue light (BL) resulting from lesions in the gene encoding the BL receptor cryptochrome 1 (cry1). Phytochrome A and cry1 are identified as the major photoreceptors mediating BL-induced de-etiolation in tomato, and act under low and high irradiances, respectively. Phytochromes B1 and B2 also contribute to BL sensing, and the relative contribution of each of these four photoreceptors differs according to the light conditions and the specific process examined. Development of the phyA phyB1 phyB2 cry1 quadruple mutant under WL is severely impaired, and seedlings die before flowering. The quadruple mutant is essentially blind to BL, but experiments employing simultaneous irradiation with BL and red light suggest that an additional non-phytochrome photoreceptor may be active under short daily BL exposures. In addition to effects on de-etiolation, cry1 is active in older, WL-grown plants, and influences stem elongation, apical dominance, and the chlorophyll content of leaves and fruit. These results provide the first mutant-based characterization of cry1 in a plant species other than Arabidopsis."}
{"docid": 27966269, "title": "The effect of blue-blocking and neutral intraocular lenses on circadian photoentrainment and sleep one year after cataract surgery.", "text": "PURPOSE: To compare the long-term effect on circadian photoentrainment and sleep in patients implanted with neutral and blue-blocking intraocular lenses 1\u00a0year after cataract surgery. METHODS: Randomized, controlled trial involving 67 patients with age-related cataract. Intervention was cataract surgery with implantation of either a neutral or a blue-blocking intraocular lens (IOL). Main outcome was activation of the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGC) measured by chromatic pupillometry. The circadian rhythm was analysed by 24-hr melatonin profiles and actigraphy; the latter was also used to determine objective sleep quality. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index determined subjective sleep quality. RESULTS: One year after surgery, peak melatonin concentration was 3.3\u00a0pg/ml (95% CI, 2-5.5) corresponding to 50% lower for the participants allocated to blue-blocking IOLs compared with participants allocated to neutral IOLs. Compared with preoperative levels, the ipRGC response had increased by 13.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.2-22.6) 1\u00a0year after surgery. Objective sleep quality was also improved as the time of wakefulness after sleep onset had improved by 5\u00a0min (95% CI, 1-10) for the entire population while sleep efficiency had increased by two percentage points (95% CI, 0.42-3.65) although exclusively, for the participants allocated to blue-blocking IOLs. CONCLUSION: Blue-blocking IOLs increased sleep efficiency but lowered nocturnal melatonin secretion compared with neutral IOLs. Cataract surgery improved the response of ipRGCs and sleep quality. However, the effect of cataract surgery on sleep quality may be unrelated to circadian photoentrainment."}
{"docid": 16445433, "title": "Age-related maculopathy and the impact of blue light hazard.", "text": "The pathogenesis of age-related maculopathy (ARM), the most common cause of visual loss after the age of 60 years, is indeed a complicated scenario that involves a variety of hereditary and environmental factors. The pathological cellular and molecular events underlying retinal photochemical light damage, including photoreceptor apoptosis, have been analysed in experimental animal models. Studies of age-related alterations of the retina and photoreceptors, the accumulation of lipofuscin in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, and the formation of drusen have greatly contributed to our knowledge. A new concept of an inflammatory response to drusen has emerged, suggesting immunogenic and systemic reactions in Bruch's membrane and the subretinal space. Oxidative stress and free radical damage also impact on the photoreceptors and RPE cells in the ageing eye. Based on the photoelectric effect, a fundamental concept in quantum physics, the consequences of high-energy irradiation have been analysed in animal models and cell culture. Short-wavelength radiation (rhodopsin spectrum), and the blue light hazard (excitation peak 440 nm), have been shown to have a major impact on photoreceptor and RPE function, inducing photochemical damage and apoptotic cell death. Following cataract surgery, there is a dramatic change in ocular transmittance. In aphakic or pseudophakic eyes (with clear intraocular lenses), high-energy (blue) and ultraviolet-A radiation strikes the retina. Epidemiological data indicate a significantly increased 5-year incidence of late ARM in non-phakic eyes compared with phakic eyes. In recent years, putative prophylactic measures against ARM have emerged. The implantation of 'yellow' intraocular lenses (IOLs) that absorb high-energy blue radiation is, from a theoretical point of view, the most rational approach, and, from a practical point of view, is easy to accomplish. With increasing age, RPE cells accumulate lipofuscin (chromophore A2E). It is noteworthy that the yellow IOL not only protects A2E-laden human RPE cells from blue light (peak 430 nm) damage, but also alleviates the detrimental effects of green (peak 550 nm) and white light. A prophylactic treatment using antioxidants is aimed at counteracting oxidative stress and free radical cellular damage. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), a randomized clinical trial, showed a significantly lower incidence of late ARM in a cohort of patients with drusen maculopathy treated with high doses of antioxidants than in a placebo group. In recent years, considerable progress in retinal research has been achieved, creating a platform for the search for new prophylactic and therapeutic measures to alleviate or prevent photoreceptor and RPE degeneration in ARM."}

METHODS: Retrospective, monocentric case series including 98 consecutive naive neovascular age-related macular degeneration patients. Presence of RPD was assessed by two graders based on color, blue-light, fundus autofluorescence pictures, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. A correlation between the presence of RPD and the visual change was investigated. Other baseline characteristics studied in a monovariate and multivariate analysis were the following: age, gender, affected side, loading dose, type of neovascularization, presence of retinal pigment epithelial detachment >250 \u03bcm, subretinal or intraretinal fluid, blood over >50% of the lesion, and subfoveal choroidal thickness. RESULTS: The presence of RPD was not associated with a visual change (P = 0.96), but with a thin subfoveal choroidal thickness at baseline (P < 0.0001). The monovariate analysis showed that the presence of blood at baseline was associated with visual gain (P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: The presence of RPD at baseline was not identified as a factor associated with a poor 1-year response to ranibizumab in eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration.

Vertebrate Opn3/TMT opsins are further classified into four groups on the basis of their amino acid identities. However, there is limited information about molecular properties of these groups, due to the difficulty in preparing the recombinant proteins. Here, we successfully expressed recombinant proteins of TMT1 and TMT2 opsins of medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) in cultured cells and characterized their molecular properties. Spectroscopic and biochemical studies demonstrated that TMT1 and TMT2 opsins functioned as blue light-sensitive Gi/Go-coupled receptors, but exhibited spectral properties and photo-convertibility of the active state different from each other. TMT1 opsin forms a visible light-absorbing active state containing all-trans-retinal, which can be photo-converted to 7-cis- and 9-cis-retinal states in addition to the original 11-cis-retinal state. In contrast, the active state of TMT2 opsin is a UV light-absorbing state having all-trans-retinal and does not photo-convert to any other state, including the original 11-cis-retinal state. Thus, TMT opsins are diversified so as to form a different type of active state, which may be responsible for their different functions."}

DESIGN: Prospective controlled study. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-seven patients with age-related cataract (61 eyes). METHODS: Patients were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 groups and implanted with either aspherical IOLs, Acrysof IQ (SN60WF) or Tecnis Z9001, or a spherical IOL, Acrysof Natural. Patients underwent routine examinations, including visual acuity, slit-lamp checks, and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), as well as measurement of higher-order aberrations and CS values, preoperatively and at 1 week, 1 month, and 2 months postoperatively. RESULTS: All the patients had a BCVA better than 20/30 postoperatively.

No statistically significant difference was found in spherical aberration, coma, or higher-order aberration between the IQ and Tecnis groups. Under glare conditions, the CS values of the 2 aspherical IOLs were obviously better (IQ: p < 0.05; Tecnis: p < 0.05) than the CS value of the spherical IOL group at low frequency (IQ: 6.3 degrees, Tecnis: 4.0 degrees); under non-glare conditions there was a significant difference in CS values between the aspherical IOL groups and the control group (IQ: p < 0.01; Tecnis: p < 0.01) at low frequency (both 6.3 degrees). There was no statistical difference between the IQ and the Tecnis groups with or without glare. CONCLUSIONS: An aspherical IOL can effectively reduce spherical aberration after cataract surgery, enhance CS values, and improve visual quality compared with traditional spherical IOLs for age-related cataract. However, there was no statistically significant difference in postoperative aberration and CS values between the Acrysof IQ and Tecnis Z9001 aspherical IOLs."}

To identify genes whose expression may change under conditions of bisretinoid accumulation, we investigated the differential gene expression in RPE cells that had accumulated the lipofuscin fluorophore A2E and were exposed to blue light (430 nm). METHODS: A2E-laden RPE cells were exposed to blue light (A2E/430 nm) at various time intervals. Cell death was quantified using Dead Red staining, and RNA levels for the entire genome was determined using DNA microarrays (Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome 2.0 Plus). Array results for selected genes were confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Principal component analysis revealed that the A2E-laden RPE cells irradiated with blue light were clearly distinguishable from the control samples. We found differential regulation of genes belonging to the following functional groups: transcription factors, stress response, apoptosis and immune response. Among the last mentioned were downregulation of four genes that coded for proteins that have an inhibitory effect on the complement cascade: (complement factor H, complement factor H-related 1, complement factor I and vitronectin) and of two belonging to the classical pathway (complement component 1, s subcomponent and complement component 1, r subcomponent). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that blue light irradiation of A2E-laden RPE cells can alter the transcription of genes belonging to different functional pathways including stress response, apoptosis and the immune response. We suggest that these molecules may be associated to the pathogenesis of AMD and can potentially serve as future therapeutic targets."}

SETTING: Iladevi Cataract & IOL Research Centre, Ahmedabad, India. METHODS: One hundred twenty consecutive patients who had phacoemulsification in a prospective triple-masked trial were randomized to receive an AcrySof SA60AT IOL (40 eyes), AcrySof Natural SN60AT IOL (40 eyes), or AcrySof IQ SN60WF IOL (40 eyes). At 3 months, contrast sensitivity was measured using the CSV-1000E contrast sensitivity chart test face (Vector Vision) at 3, 6, 12, and 18 cycles per degrees (cpd) under photopic conditions (85 cd/m(2)) and mesopic conditions (2.7 cd/m(2)) with 4.0 mm and 6.0 mm fixed central apertures, with and without glare. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used and a pair-wise comparison performed. The main outcome measure was the difference in contrast sensitivity between IOLs at each spatial frequency. RESULTS: The best corrected visual acuity was similar between the 3 IOL groups (P = .6). The AcrySof IQ group had significantly higher contrast sensitivity at 18 cpd under photopic conditions (P = .008); at 3, 6, 12, and 18 cpd during mesopic testing with a 4.0 mm aperture without glare (P = .018, P = .011, P = .007, and P = .0001, respectively) and with glare (P = .003, P = .006, P = .005, and P = .004, respectively); and at all spatial frequencies during mesopic testing with a 6.0 mm aperture without glare (P = .018, P = .006, P = .009, and P = .0001, respectively) and with glare (P = .019, P = .002, P = .01, and P = .017, respectively). CONCLUSION: Eyes with the AcrySof IQ SN60WF IOL had significantly higher contrast sensitivity than eyes with an AcrySof SA60AT or AcrySof Natural SN60AT IOL at all spatial frequencies during mesopic testing (with and without glare) with 4.0 and 6.0 mm artificial pupil."}

DESIGN: Experimental study and human trial. PARTICIPANTS: Three foldable hydrophobic acrylic IOLs (enVista MX60, AcrySof SN60AT, and Tecnis 1 ZCB00). METHODS: The unfolding times of 3 kinds of IOLs were measured according to temperature from 26\u00b0C to 32\u00b0C in a transparent container filled with a mixture of OVDs and balanced salt solution. The unfolding time of each IOL was measured 4 times for each temperature. Unfolding time was defined as the time required for the folded IOL to recover \u2265 90% of its overall optic diameter before folding. In human trials, the unfolding time of the MX60 in a capsular bag filled with 30\u00b0C OVDs was compared with that filled with room temperature OVDs for 4 cases in each group. RESULTS: The unfolding time of the MX60 (215 \u00b1 25 seconds) was significantly longer than that of the SN60AT (28 \u00b1 7 seconds) and the ZCB00 (29 \u00b1 7 seconds) at 26\u00b0C (p = 0.013). However, there were no differences in the unfolding time of 3 IOLs at 32\u00b0C. In human trials, the unfolding time of the MX60 was shorter in a capsular bag filled with 30\u00b0C OVDs (32 \u00b1 13 seconds) than if filled with OVDs kept at room temperature (127 \u00b1 27 seconds; p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: When fast and complete unfolding characteristics are needed, filling the anterior chamber and capsular bag with OVDs warmed to 30\u00b0C before IOL implantation is recommended."}

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary eye care centre in North India and studied 33 eyes of 33 patients ( with previously operated trabeculectomy), who underwent phacoemulsification. Trypan blue dye (0.06%) was used to stain the anterior capsule. After completion of phacoemulsification, the staining of the trabeculectomy bleb was noted as diffuse, patchy, minimal or no staining. RESULTS: Of the 33 eyes, 13 had diffuse staining (39.4%, mean IOP = 9.3 \u00b1 2.2 mm Hg), 7 (21.2%, mean IOP= 15.5 \u00b1 1.8 mm Hg) had patchy staining, 4 had minimal staining (12.1%, mean IOP= 17.5 \u00b1 0.5mm Hg) and nine (27.3%, mean IOP= 19.3 \u00b1 1.6 mm Hg) had no staining. These staining patterns were labeled as groups 1 - 4 respectively. Statistical analysis showed that the difference between the IOPs in Group 1 - 2 and between Group 2 - 3 was not significant statistically (p=0.682 and 0.665 respectively). However the differences between the IOPs between Groups 1 - 3, 1 - 4, 2 - 4, and 3 - 4 were found to be highly significant statistically (p less than 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: Trypan blue dye can be used to test the amount of sub conjunctival filtration in eyes undergoing phacoemulsification cataract surgery."}

METHODS: The authors assessed visual function and macular appearance in the fellow eye or both eyes of 132 white patients with unilateral neovascular AMD. All patients had a visual acuity of 20/60 or better in the fellow eye. Eighty-nine of the patients were coded as having light irides (blue, green, or hazel) and 43 were coded as having dark irides (brown); the two groups of patients had comparable mean ages. RESULTS: By the Mann-Whitney test for differences in mean rank, fellow eyes with light irides showed a marginally worse visual acuity (P = .156) but significantly more visual field impairment by letter recognition perimetry (P = .011) and the macular threshold test of the Humphrey Field Analyzer (P = .043), and more retinal pigment epithelial atrophy (P = .017) and focal areas of hyperpigmentation (P = .002) than fellow eyes with dark irides. For eyes with a choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM), those with light irides had significantly lower visual acuities (P = .006) and larger scars (P = .006) than eyes with dark irides. In addition, extent of disease in the eye with a CNVM was positively correlated with extent of disease in the fellow eye for most comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that light iris pigmentation is associated with more extensive retinal disease in patients with unilateral neovascular AMD. Furthermore, in such patients, those with worse disease in the eye with a CNVM may tend to have more extensive atrophic disease in the fellow eye."}

METHODS: The retinal damage of rats was induced by blue light exposure for 6 hours and examined 8 hours, 16 hours and 24 hours after the exposure. One hundred female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups. Group 1 included 30 rats received light exposure without any other treatment. Group 2 included 30 rats received light exposure with intraperitoneal injection of normal saline. Group 3 included 30 rats received light exposure with intraperitoneal injection of saturated hydrogen saline. And Group 4 included the other 10 rats which did not receive any treatment. The amount of intraperitoneal injection of saturated hydrogen saline and normal saline was calculated in the ratio of 1ml/100g of rat weight. Specimens were collected and processed by H-E staining, ultrastructure observation, biochemical measurement. Morphological changes were observed by light microscope and transmission electron microscope (TEM) and the retinal outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness was measured by IPP 6.0, while the malondialdehyde (MDA) was measured by colorimetric determination at 532 nm. RESULTS: Although the structure of retina in Group 1 and Group 2 was injured heavily, the injury in Group 3 was mild. The differences between Group 1 and Group 2 were not significant. Compared with the rats in Group 1 and Group 2, the ones in Group 3 had more clearly demarcated retina structure and more ordered cells by light microscope and TEM observation. The ONL thicknesses (400 times) of four groups at each time point except between Group 1 and Group 2 were significantly different (P<0.05). The thicknesses of the ONL in Group 1 at three time points were 30.41\u00b14.04\u00b5m, 26.11\u00b12.82\u00b5m and 20.63\u00b11.06\u00b5m, in Group 2 were 31.62\u00b14.54\u00b5m, 25.08\u00b13.63\u00b5m and 19.07\u00b13.86\u00b5m, in Group 3 were 29.75\u00b13.62\u00b5m, 28.83\u00b11.97\u00b5m and 27.61\u00b11.83\u00b5m. In Group 4 the mean of the thickness was 37.35\u00b11.37\u00b5m. As time went by, the damage grew more severely. At 24h point, the differences were most significant. Compared with Group 4, the thickness was 46.23% thinner in Group 1, 50.29% thinner in Group 2 and 28.04% thinner in Group 3. The stack structures of membranous disc in Group 3 were injured slightly, but in Group 1 and Group 2 the damage was more obvious by TEM. Compared with Group 4 at each time point, the content of MDA in Group 1 was higher (P<0.05). The content of MDA in Group 3 was significantly lower than those of Group 1 (P<0.05) and Group 2 (P<0.05). Between the Group 1 and Group 2, the MDA concentration at each time point was no significant difference (P>0.05).

We performed genetic screens in low white light-a threshold condition in which photomorphogenetic signaling pathways are only partially active-for ethyl methane sulfonate-generated mutants with altered developmental phenotypes. Recessive mutants with exaggerated developmental responses were obtained in eight complementation groups designated shl for seedlings hyperresponsive to light. shl1, shl2, shl5, and shl3 shl4 (double mutant) seedlings showed limited or no phenotypic effects in darkness, but showed significantly enhanced inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in low-white, red, far-red, blue, and green light across a range of fluences. These results reflect developmental hyper-responsiveness to signals generated by both phytochrome and cryptochrome photoreceptors. The shl11 mutant retained significant phenotypic effects on hypocotyl length in both the phyA mutant and phyB mutant backgrounds but may be dependent on CRY1 for phenotypic expression in blue light. The shl2 phenotype was partially dependent on PHYB, PHYA, and CRY1 in red, far-red, and blue light, respectively. shl2 and, in particular, shl1 were partially dependent on HY5 activity for their light-hyperresponsive phenotypes. The SHL genes act (genetically) as light-dependent negative regulators of photomorphogenesis, possibly in a downstream signaling or developmental pathway that is shared by CRY1, PHYA, and PHYB and other photoreceptors (CRY2, PHYC, PHYD, and PHYE)."}

METHODS: A retrospective review of 38 consecutive eyes with macular hole, operated on with internal limiting membrane peeling (ILM), using or not using infracyanine (ICG), diluted in glucose 5% and filtered. Anatomical and functional results were analysed in each group, using visual field testing, fluorescein fundus angiography and particularly blue filter fundus photographs for the detection of retinal pigment epithelial changes and lesions of optic nerve fibres layer. RESULTS: Fifteen eyes underwent surgery without ICG and 23 eyes with ICG. The mean period of follow-up was 10 months. The duration of surgery was significantly lower in the group with ICG than without (P < 0.001). Overall, 84% of the holes closed without difference between both groups. The improvement in vision at 1, 6 and 12 months was similar in both groups. Fewer defects in the optic nerve fibres layer were observed in the group with ICG than without (P = 0.02). Staining with ICG revealed the presence of an associated epiretinal membrane in 61% of eyes, whereas it was clinically visible in only 17.5% before surgery. CONCLUSION: Using ICG for ILM peeling produced similar visual results to those obtained without ICG. It reduced significantly the duration of surgery and the trauma to the optic nerve fibres layer, without increasing the risk of retinal pigment epithelial damage. However, in the light of recent reports about the possible toxicity of ICG, its use should be restricted in clinical practice to difficult cases."}

We investigated whether cutoff filters result in improved reading ability in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). METHODS: Reading performance was examined in 22 patients with AMD aged 63-91 years (visual acuity 0.1-0.5) using the Radner reading charts. These charts were presented in random order either with or without cutoff filters (Zeiss CF 540 and CF 580) monocularly to the better eye using a defined luminance of the test charts of 105 cd/m(2). RESULTS: Using the CF 540 cutoff filter, there was no significant change in visual acuity while there was a tendency to decrease. Calculating the LogRAD score, which takes reading errors into account, three patients improved by one line, while nine deteriorated, six of them by one line or more. There was no significant improvement using the CF 580 compared to either the CF 540 or to normal reading glasses. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found no measurable improvement using the CF 540 cutoff filter. The cutoff filter CF 580, tested for additional comparison, did not show any advantage."}

A2E has been concerned in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). METHODS: To perform this study, A2E-accumulated ARPE-19 cells were exposed to blue light to induce cytotoxicity. The cytotoxicity and apoptotic gene expression levels were evaluated using a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay and real-time PCR analysis, respectively. KEY FINDINGS: Curcuma longa L. extract was found to exert a protective effect in a dose-dependent manner. At a concentration of 15 \u03bcm, curcumin, demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin exerted significant protective effects against blue light-induced cytotoxicity. Treatment with CLE and curcuminoids meaningfully reduced the mRNA levels of c-Abl and p53, which was known to be augmented in apoptotic RPE cells. Demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin were found to inhibit p38 expression, which is increased in blue light-irradiated A2E-accumulated RPE cells. CONCLUSIONS: Curcuma longa L. extract and its curcuminoids provided significant protection against photooxidative damage and apoptosis in the RPE cells. Our results suggest that curcuminoids may show potential in the treatment of AMD."}

Following drug treatment both cone and rod thresholds were reduced in patients. In comparison to controls, drug treatment normalized cone threshold and reduced rod threshold in patients. 5. These data provide ophthalmological evidence for increased sensitivity to light in non medicated depressive disorder and a reduction in sensitivity following antidepressant drug therapy. 6.

DESIGN: Intraindividual, prospective, randomized clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-six cataract patients received 2, one-piece, blue-light-filtering hydrophobic acrylic IOLs each. METHODS: One eye was implanted with a spherical (SN60AT, Alcon) and the contralateral eye with an aspheric (SN60WF, Alcon) IOL with -0.2 mum spherical aberration (SA). All trial-specific measurements (corneal topography, wavefront sensing, high-contrast visual acuity [HCVA], contrast sensitivity [CS]) were performed 6 months after surgery. A paired Student t-test or Wilcoxon test was used to check intergroup differences. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Absolute values and intraindividual differences (Delta(i)) of corneal and ocular higher order aberrations and best-corrected visual Strehl ratio based on the optical transfer function (BCVSOTF) values for virtual pupil diameters of 3, 4, 5, and 6 mm were computed. Photopic and mesopic HCVA, photopic, and high-mesopic CS as well as high-mesopic disability glare (DG) were measured using the Frankfurt-Freiburg Contrast and Acuity Test System. RESULTS: No intergroup difference of demographic data, pupillometry, and corneal aberrations were observed. Coma and trefoil root mean square and SA were significantly lower in the aspheric group resulting in higher BCVSOTF, mesopic HCVA, and photopic and high mesopic CS. All Delta(i) values with exception of photopic HCVA and DG indicated significantly better performance of the aspheric IOL.

METHODS: Eleven visually normal participants completed the experiment. Lacrimation was measured in one eye by placing a calibrated filter paper strip in the conjunctival sac over a 1 minute-interval (Schirmer's test) during which participants received either no light stimulation (baseline trial) or one flash of blue or red light stimuli presented binocularly with a Ganzfeld stimulator, while the pupil response was recorded simultaneously from the fellow eye by using an eye tracker. Light stimulation trials were presented in alternating fashion at seven incremental intensity steps (0.1, 1, 3.16, 10, 31.6, 100, and 400 cd/m2). Postillumination pupil response was defined as the mean pupil constriction from 10 to 30 seconds post illumination. RESULTS: The amount of lacrimation in response to 10 to 400 cd/m2 blue light was significantly greater than baseline and increased monotonically with increasing light intensity. Red light did not induce significant reflex lacrimation until the brightest stimulation at 400 cd/m2. There was a positive linear correlation between PIPR and lacrimation in response to blue light (r = 0.74, P < 0.001) but not to red light (r = 0.13, P = 0.25). CONCLUSIONS: The chromatic characteristics and intensity-response of light-induced lacrimation are highly consistent with the features of melanopsin phototransduction. This finding is the first in vivo evidence in humans, supporting the hypothesis that light-induced reflex lacrimation is mediated primarily by melanopsin photoactivity, and provides new insight into the putative mechanisms of photophobia."}

We wished to determine the effects of administering acetazolamide on performance on the Nagel II anomaloscope. METHODS: We tested 15 subjects matches of blue-green light to a mixture of blue and green lights (luminance match) on a Nagel type II anomaloscope 2.5 h after ingesting 500 mg of acetazolamide or a placebo. RESULTS: The mean of the luminance settings for the subjects was 54.4 for the placebo condition and 58.5 for the acetazolamide condition. The mean difference of 4.1 was statistically significant, indicating that following ingestion of acetazolamide subjects were less sensitive to a blue-green light. In two supplementary experiments we tested (1) a second group of four normal subjects using the Nagel type II anomaloscope and (2) the previously untreated eyes of four patients with primary open-angle glaucoma before and after placing them on acetazolamide therapy. In both groups, more blue-green light was needed to make the match after ingestion of acetazolamide. CONCLUSIONS: Acetazolamide alters the sensitivity of one or more cone populations, probably the carbonic anhydrase-containing cones. The sensitivity loss is reversible and does not appear to be clinically significant. However, the results suggest that patients administered acetazolamide should be excluded from studies which compare the color vision of glaucomatous patients to that of normals."}
{"docid": 27580077, "title": "Blue-Black or White-Gold? Early Stage Processing and the Color of 'The Dress'.", "text": "PURPOSE: In Feb 2015 an image of a dress posted on Tumblr triggered an internet phenomenon: Is the Dress blue and black (BB) or white and gold (WG)? Many claim BB and others insist WG while the true colors are BB. The prevailing theory is that assumptions about the illuminant govern perception of the Dress with WG due to bluish lighting and BB due to yellowish. Our purpose was to determine if early stage optical, retinal and/or neural factors also impact perception of the Dress. METHODS: Thirty-nine subjects were categorized as BB or WG based on their initial perception of the Dress and their perception reported when viewing the Dress on iPhone 5, iPad, and 22\" LCD displays. Macular pigment optical density (MPOD) measured with the QuantifEye\u2122 MPS II and visual brainwaves (VEPs) in response to brief presentations of a transparency of the Dress illuminated by a flashing light were measured on each subject and compared between BB and WG groups. Additionally, CIE chromaticity (color) and luminance (brightness) were measured from multiple areas of the Dress image to determine cone stimulation and contrast. RESULTS: Mean MPOD was higher in the WG group (0.49) vs. the BB (0.41, p = 0.04) and median values were higher as well (WG = 0.46, BB = 0.36, p = 0.03). There was no difference in VEP amplitude between groups (p > 0.85) but mean VEP latency was longer in WG (130 msec.) vs. the BB group (107 msec., p = 0.0005). Colorimetry of the Dress showed significantly greater stimulation of blue cones (contrast = 73%) vs. red and green sensitive cones (contrast = 13%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that observers with denser MPOD may be predisposed to perceive the Dress as WG due to great absorption of blue light by the macular pigment. Moreover, the novel, substantial stimulation of blue cones by the Dress may contribute to ambiguity and dichotomous perception since the blue cones are so sparse in the retina. Finally, the delayed WG VEPs indicate distinct neural processing in perception of the consistent with fMRI evidence that the WG percept is processed at higher cortical levels than the BB. These results do not fully explain the dichotomous perception of the Dress but do exemplify the need to consider early stage processing when elucidating ambiguous percepts and figures."}

The goal of this study was to quantify differences in the pupillary re-dilation following exposure to red versus blue light in patients with outer retinal disease and compare them with patients with optic neuropathy and with healthy subjects. DESIGN: Prospective comparative cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-three patients with outer retinal disease, 13 patients with optic neuropathy and 14 normal subjects. METHODS: Subjects were tested using continuous red and blue light stimulation at three intensities (1, 10 and 100 cd/m2) for 13 s per intensity. Pupillary re-dilation dynamics following the brightest intensity was analysed and compared between the three groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The parameters of pupil re-dilation used in this study were: time to recover 90% of baseline size; mean pupil size at early and late phases of re-dilation; and differential re-dilation time for blue versus red light. RESULTS: Patients with outer retinal disease showed a pupil that tended to stay smaller after light termination and thus had a longer time to recovery. The differential re-dilation time was significantly greater in patients with outer retinal disease (median = 28.0 s, P < 0.0001) compared with controls and patients with optic neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: A differential response of pupil re-dilation following red versus blue light stimulation is present in patients with outer retinal disease but is not found in normal eyes or among patients with visual loss from optic neuropathy."}

Of the level 2b studies, only one (14.3%) found in favor of blue-light-filtering IOLs vs ultraviolet (UV)-only filtering IOLs on the basis of an association between better post-operative contrast sensitivity (CS) at select frequencies with the former; however, that study did not measure or report CS preoperatively in either group, and the finding may simply reflect better preoperative CS in the eyes scheduled to be implanted with the blue-light-filtering IOL; moreover, that study failed to measure macular pigment, a natural preceptoral filter of blue-light, augmentation of which is now known to improve CS. In terms of photoprotection, there is no level 2b (or higher) evidence in support of blue filtering IOLs vs UV-only filtering IOLs. On the basis of currently available evidence, one cannot advocate for the use of blue-light-filtering IOLs over UV-only filtering IOLs."}

METHODS: This was a prospective analytical study. We studied sixty-four eyes from 32 patients with cataracts. After a random assignment, phacoemulsification with the implant was performed using the Acrysof SN60AT tinted lens in one eye and Acrysof SA60 in the other. A variety of variables was subsequently assessed: contrast sensitivity with a CSV 1000E test, colour perception through a Farnsworth 25 test and subjective measures by a patient survey. Differences between the groups were assessed statistically. RESULTS: The contrast sensitivity results were obtained for 3, 6, 12 and 18 cycles per degree (cpd) frequencies under scotopic conditions, with better results obtained following the use of SN60AT: 0.75 (CSV 1000E test units) for 3 cpd, 0.86 for 6 cpd, 0.54 for 12 cpd and 0.35 for 18 cpd. The differences were statistically significant between the two groups for 3 cpd and 6 cpd. A total of 62.5% of patients using a tinted lens and 50% with SA60 achieved good results in the Farnsworth test; 12.5% and 21% had fair results and 25% and 28.1% respectively had poor results. CONCLUSIONS: We obtained an improvement in favour of the tinted lens for all frequencies, with this being statistically significant at lower frequencies (3 and 6 cpd). No significant differences in the Farnsworth test performance or in the patient survey were found. The tinting provided by the IMPRUV filter brings an increase in contrast sensitivity without affecting colour perception."}

METHODS: We carried out a randomized double-blind study. An Acrysof Natural IOL (model SN60AT) was implanted in 25 eyes of 19 patients and an Acrysof IOL (model SA60AT) was implanted in 27 eyes of 18 control patients. The patients returned for colour vision tests and fundus photography 1-6 months after the surgery. RESULTS: Standard pseudoisochromatic plates, part 2, were correctly interpreted and the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test (FM 100) total and individual box scores were normal in all IOL eyes. In the FM 100 hue test there were no significant differences in the results of the total error scores or the error scores of the individual boxes between the eyes with Acrysof Natural and those with Acrysof lenses. The yellow coloration of the Acrysof Natural IOL did not affect the visibility of the RNFL in photographs. CONCLUSIONS: The Acrysof Natural IOL did not affect colour vision in the tested patients, even in the blue region of the spectrum, and can be implanted in patients who need to have normal colour vision for the purposes of their occupation. The Acrysof Natural IOL does not interfere with RNFL photography and can also be used in patients with glaucoma."}

Dry AMD treatment with Rheopheresis Trial-ART.", "text": "PURPOSE: To evaluate Rheopheresis for the treatment of patients with high-risk dry age-related macular degeneration and no therapeutic alternative. Rheopheresis is a method of therapeutic apheresis using the methodology of double filtration plasmapheresis to treat microcirculatory disorders. METHODS: The dry AMD treatment with Rheopheresis trial (ART) was a randomised, controlled clinical study. Patients with the diagnosis of AMD in both eyes, with the study eye presenting dry AMD and soft drusen (the fellow eye had advanced AMD) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive ten Rheopheresis treatments within 17 weeks or to remain untreated. The primary outcome was change in best-corrected ETDRS-visual acuity (mean logMar change) after 7.5 months compared to baseline visual acuity for both groups. RESULTS: Forty-three eyes of 43 patients (22 treatment and 21 control group) were analysed. The mean baseline BCVA in study eyes was 0.58 in the treatment group and 0.66 in the control group (n.s. p = 0.19). At the primary efficacy endpoint 7.5 months post baseline, there was a statistically significant mean difference of 0.95 ETDRS lines (p = 0.01) between the Rheopheresis and control groups. Nine percent of eyes in the group treated with Rheopheresis gained 2 or more ETDRS lines, as compared with 0% of eyes with no treatment. None of the treated patients had a loss in visual acuity in their study eyes, as compared with 24% of patients without treatment who lost 1 ETDRS line or more; 19% lost 2 ETDRS lines or more. Rheopheresis treatment was safe and well-tolerated. CONCLUSION: The results of ART provide further evidence that Rheopheresis is a safe and effective therapeutic option for high-risk patients with dry AMD and no therapeutic alternative. A series of Rheopheresis treatments can improve the natural course of AMD for selected patients."}

The protocol for plasmapheresis followed the Multicenter Investigation of Rheopheresis for AMD (MIRA) trial and consisted of four pulses of paired sessions of plasmapheresis with a two-day interval within 10 weeks. The pre-DFPP best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) for the right eye was 6/15 (0.4). Six months after DFPP treatment, the BCVA of the right eye was 6/10 (0.6) and remained unchanged at the 12th month; however, comparison of the right eye fundus picture, fluorescein angiogram, and optical coherence tomography of the macular area before and 6 and 12 months after plasmapheresis revealed no discernable changes. The per-session and per-course clearance rates were highest for IgM (63.8% and 90.8%) and lowest for albumin (11% and 15.4%). No plasmapheresis-related complications, such as hypotension, hemolysis or infection, occurred. Thus, DFPP treatment can provide effective treatment for dry type AMD with minimal side-effects."}

(wolfberry; Kei Tze) in a food-based human supplementation trial.", "text": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common disorder that causes irreversible loss of central vision. Increased intake of foods containing zeaxanthin may be effective in preventing AMD because the macula accumulates zeaxanthin and lutein, oxygenated carotenoids with antioxidant and blue light-absorbing properties. Lycium barbarum L. is a small red berry known as Fructus lycii and wolfberry in the West, and Kei Tze and Gou Qi Zi in Asia. Wolfberry is rich in zeaxanthin dipalmitate, and is valued in Chinese culture for being good for vision. The aim of this study, which was a single-blinded, placebo-controlled, human intervention trial of parallel design, was to provide data on how fasting plasma zeaxanthin concentration changes as a result of dietary supplementation with whole wolfberries. Fasting blood was collected from healthy, consenting subjects; fourteen subjects took 15 g/d wolfberry (estimated to contain almost 3 mg zeaxanthin) for 28 d. Repeat fasting blood was collected on day 29. Age- and sex-matched controls (n 13) took no wolfberry. Responses in the two groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. After supplementation, plasma zeaxanthin increased 2.5-fold: mean values on day 1 and 29 were 0.038 (sem 0.003) and 0.096 (sem 0.009) micromol/l (P<0.01), respectively, for the supplementation group; and 0.038 (sem 0.003) and 0.043 (sem 0.003) micromol/l (P>0.05), respectively, for the control group. This human supplementation trial shows that zeaxanthin in whole wolfberries is bioavailable and that intake of a modest daily amount markedly increases fasting plasma zeaxanthin levels. These new data will support further study of dietary strategies to maintain macular pigment density."}

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 99 patients (120 eyes) divided on three groups were examined. 40 patients (40 eyes) after cataract surgery with implantation of blue light filtering lens were the first group. 39 patients (40 eyes) who had implanted lens without filter were the second group. 20 patients (40 eyes) with own transparent lens were the third group. Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue test was used in research. Each patient made test on thirtieth day after cataract surgery. RESULTS: Following average total error score (TES) values in groups were observed: the first group--60.66, the second group--83.71, the third group--61.55. Average axis of disorder in blue-yellow range was following: patients after cataract surgery with implantation of blue light filtering lens--5.48, patients with implant without blue light filter--7.28, control group--5.74. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Kind of artificial intraocular lens has meaning in colour vision at pseudophakic patients. 2. Blue light filter of artificial intraocular foldable lens advantageously effects perception of colours. 3. Lack of blue light filter in artificial intraocular lens gets worse colour vision especially in blue-yellow range."}

Blue-blocking (BB) glasses are a potential treatment option for bipolar mania. We examined the effectiveness of BB glasses in hospitalized patients with bipolar disorder in a manic state. METHODS: In a single-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (RCT), eligible patients (with bipolar mania; age 18-70\u00a0years) were recruited from five clinics in Norway. Patients were assigned to BB glasses or placebo (clear glasses) from 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. for 7\u00a0days, in addition to treatment as usual. Symptoms were assessed daily by use of the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Motor activity was assessed by actigraphy, and compared to data from a healthy control group. Wearing glasses for one evening/night qualified for inclusion in the intention-to-treat analysis. RESULTS: From February 2012 to February 2015, 32 patients were enrolled. Eight patients dropped out and one was excluded, resulting in 12 patients in the BB group and 11 patients in the placebo group. The mean decline in YMRS score was 14.1 [95% confidence interval (CI): 9.7-18.5] in the BB group, and 1.7 (95% CI: -4.0 to 7.4) in the placebo group, yielding an effect size of 1.86 (Cohen's d). In the BB group, one patient reported headache and two patients experienced easily reversible depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This RCT shows that BB glasses are effective and feasible as add-on treatment for bipolar mania."}
{"docid": 15870573, "title": "Light energy, cataract surgery, and progression of age-related macular degeneration.", "text": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Some studies suggest an association between light exposure and increased risk of advanced age-related macular degeneration. The natural lens serves as a barrier to some of the higher energy light rays. There is some concern that cataract surgery may be contributing to the increase in prevalence of age-related macular degeneration. RECENT FINDINGS: It has been shown that blue light absorption by retinal pigment epithelium results in free radical formation, leading to cellular injury, and that blue filters can reduce this rate of cell death. Other studies have shown a tendency for pseudophakic eyes to progress to the wet form of age-related macular degeneration more so than their fellow eyes. SUMMARY: Currently there is no conclusive evidence to support a relation between progression of age-related macular degeneration and cataract surgery. Given that nearly two million cataract extractions are performed yearly, a large randomized controlled study is required to prove or disprove the ability of tinted intraocular lenses to aid in preventing the progression of age-related macular degeneration."}
{"docid": 22527312, "title": "Iris color and visual functions.", "text": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate if iris color is associated with differences in visual functions such as intraocular straylight (IOSL), contrast sensitivity (CS), or best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, which is a subgroup analysis of a large prospective trial about visual impairments in European car drivers, we included 853 persons between 20 and 80 years of age and without a history of ocular surgery or any eye disease including cataract. Subjects participated in an ophthalmological examination, grading of lens opacity, and the measurement of visual functions such as IOSL, CS, and BCVA. Dependent on iris color, participants were divided into four groups: light-blue, blue-grey, green-hazel, and brown. RESULTS: Independent of age, IOSL was significantly (all p values < 0.0001, Fisher's LSD test) higher in participants with light-blue colored iris (1.14 log(IOSL) [95 % CI: 1.11-1.17]) compared to participants with blue-grey (1.07 log(IOSL) [95 % CI: 1.05-1.09]), green-hazel (1.06 log(IOSL) [95 % CI: 1.04-1.08]) or brown (1.06 log(IOSL) [95 % CI: 1.04-1.08]) iris color. CS was also lower in participants with light-blue pigmented irises (1.60 log(CS) [95 % CI: 1.58-1.62]) than in the other groups, but statistically significant (p = 0.013, Fisher's LSD test) only compared to brown iris color. For BCVA we could not found any difference between the four groups. CONCLUSIONS: We could show in this study that iris color has a significant impact on IOSL and to a lower degree on CS, but not on BCVA. Persons with light-blue iris color who showed significantly higher IOSL values therefore may experience disability glare in daily situations such as driving at night more often than others."}

METHODS: The study subjects were 52 persons (88 eyes) with no previous medical history. The author recorded b-waves (rod response) with red light stimulation and the x-waves (dark-adapted cone response) that appeared before the b-waves. The author also recorded b-waves with blue light stimulation, which had the same amplitude as the b-waves from the red light stimulation. The differences with respect to age and gender were studied. Waveforms of the dark-adapted cone ERGs were recorded by using a digital subtraction technique. RESULTS: The x-wave always appeared before the b-wave with 0 dB (2.4 cd.s/m2) red stimulation. With blue stimulation, a b-wave equivalent to the b-wave stimulated with the red light of 0 dB intensity appeared at an average of -14.57 dB. The implicit time for the b-wave was delayed significantly for the male group. There were no significant differences between different age groups. The dark-adapted cone ERG demonstrated the waveform of a negative response followed by a series of oscillatory potentials (OPs) and a positive response. CONCLUSIONS: The cone responses were followed by the rod responses with red light stimulation of 0 dB in the dark-adapted ERG. The waveforms of the cone ERGs were obtained in dark adaptation with red and blue light stimulation."}

Therefore, blocking blue light could create a form of physiologic darkness. Because the timing and quantity of light and darkness both affect sleep, evening use of amber lenses to block blue light might affect sleep quality. Mood is also affected by light and sleep; therefore, mood might be affected by blue light blockade. In this study, 20 adult volunteers were randomized to wear either blue-blocking (amber) or yellow-tinted (blocking ultraviolet only) safety glasses for 3 h prior to sleep. Participants completed sleep diaries during a one-week baseline assessment and two weeks' use of glasses. Outcome measures were subjective: change in overall sleep quality and positive/negative affect. Results demonstrated that sleep quality at study outset was poorer in the amber lens than the control group. Two- by three-way ANOVA revealed significant (p < .001) interaction between quality of sleep over the three weeks and experimental condition. At the end of the study, the amber lens group experienced significant (p < .001) improvement in sleep quality relative to the control group and positive affect (p = .005). Mood also improved significantly relative to controls. A replication with more detailed data on the subjects' circadian baseline and objective outcome measures is warranted."}
{"docid": 15302349, "title": "Do blue light filters confer protection against age-related macular degeneration?", "text": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major health problem in the developed world accounting for approximately half of all blind registrations. Current treatment options are unsuitable for the majority of patients and therefore the identification of modifiable risk factors that may inform disease prevention programmes is a priority. This review evaluates the long-held belief that blue light exposure has a role in the pathogenesis of AMD. Laboratory evidence has demonstrated that photochemical reactions in the oxygen-rich environment of the outer retina lead to the liberation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). These ROS cause oxidative stress which is known to contribute to the development of AMD. The precise chromopore that may be involved in the pathogenesis of AMD is unclear but the age pigment lipofuscin is a likely candidate. Its aerobic photoreactivity and adverse effects on antioxidant activity combined with its gradual accumulation over time suggests that its in vivo phototoxicity increases with age despite changes in the absorption characteristics of the crystalline lens. Evidence from animal studies confirms blue light's damaging potential but the results are not directly applicable to macular degeneration in humans. Studies of human macular pigment density and the risk of AMD progression following cataract surgery lend further weight to the hypothesis that blue light exposure has a role in the pathogenesis of AMD but the epidemiological evidence is equivocal. On balance the evidences suggests but does not yet confirm that blue light is a risk factor for AMD. Given the socio-economic impact of this disease and urgent need to identify modifiable risk factors, future work should include a large-scale clinical trial to evaluate the effect of blue blocking filters on AMD progression rates."}

Although the pathogenesis of this disease remains still obscure, several researchers have report that death of retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) caused by excessive accumulation of A2E is crucial determinants of AMD. In this study, the preventive effect of Vaccinium uliginosum L. (V.U) extract and its fractions on AMD was investigated in blue light-irradiated human RPE cell (ARPE-19 cells). Blue light-induced RPE cell death was significantly inhibited by the treatment of V.U extract or its fraction. To identify the mechanism, FAB-MS analysis revealed that V.U inhibits the photooxidation of N-retinyl-N-retinylidene ethanolamine (A2E) induced by blue light in cell free system. Moreover, monitoring by quantitative HPLC also revealed that V.U extract and its fractions reduced intracellular accumulation of A2E, suggesting that V.U extract and its fractions inhibit not only blue light-induced photooxidation, but also intracellular accumulation of A2E, resulting in RPE cell survival after blue light exposure. A2E-laden cell exposed to blue light induced apoptosis by increasing the cleaved form of caspase-3, Bax/Bcl-2. Additionally, V.U inhibited by the treatment of V.U extract or quercetin-3-O-arabinofuranoside. These results suggest that V.U extract and its fractions have preventive effect on blue light-induced damage in RPE cells and AMD."}

A new version of this lens with blue-light filtering properties purports to offer superior retinal protection. We describe our experience with this tinted lens and compare it to findings with the standard, nontinted IOL. METHODS: A chart review identified 29 eyes of 21 children (tinted lens group; age 11 months to 13 years) who had the tinted IOL implanted. The standard lens group consisted of 38 eyes (31 patients; age 11 months to 15 years). Most eyes had an intact posterior capsule at the time of implantation. RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative inflammation was fairly high in both groups (71% in the tinted lens group, 60% in the standard lens group). The tinted lens group showed a higher incidence of transient inflammation than the standard lens group (p=0.03) but the rates of nontransient sequelae (posterior synechiae, iris synechiae, membranes formation, capsule, or IOL opacification) were similar (66% versus 47%; p=0.11). Posterior capsule opacification occurred in 15 eyes in the tinted lens group and 16 eyes in the standard lens group (p=0.15) but was visually significant in only 10 and 11 eyes, respectively (p=0.77). CONCLUSIONS: Transient inflammation is higher with implantation of tinted versus nontinted IOLs, but long-term inflammatory sequelae are roughly equal, as is the rate of posterior capsule opacification. The question as to whether the chromophore in the tinted lens caused the higher incidence of transient inflammation is unresolved."}

SETTING: Six clinical sites in the United States. METHODS: Patients were from 6 clinical sites in the United States that performed a high volume of cataract surgeries. The HRQOL assessments occurred via telephone while patients were at home. Patients requiring bilateral cataract extraction were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 IOL groups for the first eye. The second eye was later implanted with the same type of IOL. Patients and HRQOL data collectors were treatment-masked, but investigators could not be. Health-related functioning and quality of life was measured with the 39-item National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-39) and 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12). Assessments were at baseline before implantation in the first eye and 30 to 60 days and 120 to 180 days after implantation of the lens in the second eye. RESULTS: Both IOL types improved most aspects of patients' HRQOL including color vision and driving. The largest gains occurred on the VFQ composite, general vision, near activities, distance activities, driving, mental health, peripheral vision, and role difficulties scales. Significant gains also occurred on color vision and other vision-specific scales as well as the SF-12 physical component summary score. There were no significant differences in HRQOL gains between the IOLs. CONCLUSION: The blue light-filtering IOL improved color vision, driving, and other aspects of HRQOL in a manner similar to that of a lens that does not filter blue light."}

SETTING: Ophthalmology Department, St. Thomas' Hospital, London, United Kingdom. METHODS: In this prospective single-surgeon standardized-surgical-procedure fellow-eye comparison, an AcrySof SN60AT or an AF-1 YA-60BB IOL was randomized to the first eye of 36 patients and fellow-eye surgery was performed within 4 to 6 weeks. Follow-up was at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Best distance- corrected logMAR visual acuity was measured at 100% and 9% contrast. Contrast sensitivity was measured using the Functional Acuity Contrast Test (FACT) on the Optec 3500 instrument (Stereo Optical Company, Inc.). Color vision was assessed with the Farnsworth Munsell 100-hue test. After pupil dilation, digital retroillumination photographs were taken and the percentage area of PCO was calculated using POCO software. RESULTS: Posterior capsule opacification was significantly greater in the AF-1 YA-60BB group than in the AcrySof SN60AT group at all time points (P<.0001), with the difference greatest at 24 months. At 24 months, 100% contrast visual acuity was significantly better in the AcrySof SN60AT group than in the AF-1 YA-60BB group (P = .0313); 9% contrast visual acuity was significantly better in the AcrySof SN60AT group from 6 months onward. There was no significant difference between groups in color vision or contrast sensitivity. Electron microscopy showed the AcrySof SN60AT IOL has a much sharper posterior edge profile. CONCLUSIONS: The AcrySof SN60AT IOL had better PCO performance and thus visual performance than the AF-1 YA-60BB IOL. This is attributable to the differences in optic edge design."}

After passing 500 ml volume bottles of each of six manufacturers' irrigating solutions through individual filters, a variety of particulate matter was observed to be trapped by the filter. In addition, I had samples of 500 ml bottles from each of seven manufacturers' irrigating solutions analyzed independently. This independent analysis involved the determination of particulate counts by Coulter counter analysis and photographic documentation of the particulate matter found in the samples. All the solutions were found to contain some particulate matter. The quantity found ranged from as few as 20 particles per ml to as many as 2,400 particles per ml. The results of this study support the use of an in-line microfiltration apparatus during planned extracapsular and phacoemulsification cataract surgery."}

METHODS: In a prospective randomized sample controlled clinical trial, 90 patients (90 eyes) with age-related cataract and corneal astigmatism were randomly divided into 3 groups: (Group A) traditional superior corneal incision phacoemulsification surgery and AcrySof SN60AT IOL implantation, (Group B) corneal topography guiding incision phacoemulsification surgery and AcrySof SN60AT IOL implantation and (Group C) corneal topography guiding incision phacoemulsification surgery and AcrySof SN60WF IOL implantation. Corneal topography tests were performed at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months postoperatively. The Wavefront aberration was measured using a custom built Tscherning wavefront sensor-ALLEGRETTO WAVE Analyze at 90 days postoperatively. Third-, 4th-, 5th-, total and higher-order aberration (HOA) root-mean-square (RMS), spherical aberration and coma aberration were compared at virtual pupil diameters of 6 mm postoperatively. Statistical analyses were performed using the analysis of chi square test, repeated measurement data analysis of variance, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and multiple comparisons Students-Newman-Keuls test. RESULTS: Corneal topography tests indicated that no significant difference for corneal astigmatism was found between these three groups preoperatively (F = 0.08, P > 0.05). The corneal astigmatism was decomposed into J(0), J(45) and P with a Vector-based method, and statistically analyzed. When compared with Group B and GroupC, Group A had higher values of corneal J(0) (F = 9.54, P < 0.01) and P (F = 18.69, P < 0.01). For corneal J(0) and P, no significant difference was found between Group B and Group C (P > 0.05). However groups and times had interactions (F = 13.45, 50.22, P < 0.01, respectively). For astigmatic vectors, there were statistical significances between different times in 3 groups (F = 74.33, 92.11, P < 0.01, respectively). Wavefront aberration test results indicated that the mean values of RMSg (root mean square of general aberration), coma aberration, RMSh, RMS(3), RMS(5) and RMS(6) of Group A were obviously higher than that of Group B and C (F = 93.40, 471.94, 176.95, 216.99, 44.37, 37.19, P < 0.01, respectively). And the values of RMS(4) and spherical aberration in Group A were significantly higher than that in Group C (q = 25.30, 26.23, P < 0.01, respectively). No statistically significant was found between Group A and Group B of RMS(4) and spherical aberration (q = 0.57, 2.34, P > 0.05, respectively). The values of RMS(4), RMSh, RMSg and spherical aberration in Group B were statistically significantly higher than that in Group C (q = 24.73, 7.90, 6.41, 23.89, P < 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Corneal topography guiding incision phacoemulsification surgery and the implantation of negative spherical aberration IOL is a more favorable solution for cataract patients coexisting corneal astigmatism, which can correct the corneal astigmatism, decrease the spherical aberration, high-order aberration and general aberration of pseudophakic eyes and therefore improve the visual quality of patients."}

The aim of this study was to investigate whether implantation of intraocular lenses (IOLs) with accurately labeled dioptric power could improve the postoperative results and allow better predictability. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 113 eyes were implanted with Crystal Evolution\u00ae (MTO) IOLs and 261 eyes with AF-1 iMics1\u00ae (Hoya) IOLs. The predictability of the postoperative spherical equivalence (SE) and the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were compared between both groups. The predictability was also compared to 2 previous studies. RESULTS: With Crystal Evolution\u00ae, the predictability was significantly better than with AF-1 iMics1\u00ae (p<0.0001). The results were also better than those described in the 2 studies. Although the BCVA obtained with Crystal Evolution\u00ae were better than with AF-1 iMics1\u00ae, the difference were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that accurate dioptric labeling of IOLs may improve the postoperative refraction outcome."}

METHODS: This prospective, comparative, randomized study included 250 eyes of 125 patients with bilateral cataracts. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either IOLs with a spherical biconvex optic (Acrysof SN6OAT [Alcon] or Sensar AR40e [Advanced Medical Optics, AMO]) or IOLs with an aspheric optic (Acrysof IQ SN6OWF [Alcon], Tecnis Z9000 [AMO], or Sofport L161AO [Bausch & Lomb]). Ophthalmologic examination including best spectacle-corrected visual acuity, pupil size, ocular dominance investigation, contrast sensitivity under mesopic and photopic conditions, and wavefront analysis was performed 2 months postoperatively. RESULTS: Aspheric IOLs showed better contrast sensitivity compared to spherical IOLs at spatial frequencies of 6, 12, and 18 cycles per degree (cpd) under photopic conditions and at all spatial frequencies under mesopic conditions. There was no significant difference among the three aspheric IOLs at all spatial frequencies under either photopic or mesopic conditions. Mean total spherical aberration was statistically lower in dominant eyes with aspheric IOLs (0.05 +/- 0.06, 0.11 +/- 0.1, and 0.19 +/- 0.08 pm for the Tecnis Z9000, Acrysof IQ SN6OWF, and Sofport L161AO, respectively) compared with eyes with spherical IOLs (0.62 +/- 0.24 and 0.46 +/- 0.19 microm for the Acrysof SN6OAT and Sensar AR40e, respectively) for a 5-mm pupil diameter. CONCLUSIONS: The aspheric IOLs had less wavefront aberrations and performed better under both photopic and mesopic contrast sensitivity compared to the spherical IOLs. These findings confirm it is possible to improve the optical performance of IOLs by modifying the surfaces."}

METHODS: This was a prospective, consecutive, nonrandomized, interventional, comparative study. One hundred eyes with cataract in 56 patients were included (SN60TT group, n=50; SN60AT group, n=50). Patients underwent phacoemulsification through a 2.2-mm temporal corneal incision. Postoperative HOAs, point spread function (PSF) and modulation transfer function (MTF), residual objective refractive astigmatism, and IOL alignment were evaluated using Optical Path Difference (OPD)-Scan II (Nidek, Gamagori, Japan). A novel technique to calculate IOL axis alignment was introduced. RESULTS: One year postoperatively, no statistical difference in corneal, intraocular, and total HOAs, Strehl ratio, and MTF based on HOAs was found between groups. Toric IOL patients had a net residual refractive astigmatism (M) of 0.44 D\u00b10.47; the difference between expected and obtained astigmatism (M) was 0.043 D (p=0.16). Toric IOL axis misalignment was 2.65\u00b12.39 degrees and no correlation with HOAs was found. CONCLUSIONS: AcrySof SN60TT determines HOAs comparable to the non-toric version providing a good optical quality, and predictably corrects corneal cylinder with a stable postoperative alignment. The OPD-Scan II might be regarded as a fast and reliable method of toric IOL analysis."}

Recent studies have shown that lutein has systemic anti-inflammatory properties. Dietary lutein has been associated with reduced circulating levels of inflammatory biomarkers such as CRP and sICAM. Whether lutein also affects activation of the complement system has not yet been addressed and was the purpose of the study described here. Seventy-two subjects with signs of early macular degeneration were randomly assigned to receive either a 10 mg lutein supplement or a placebo during one year. EDTA blood samples were collected at 0, 4, 8 and 12 months. Complement factor D (CFD), a rate limiting component of the alternative pathway of complement activation and the complement activation products C5a and C3d were determined in the plasma samples by ELISA. A significant 0.11 \u00b5g/ml monthly decrease in plasma CFD concentration was observed in the lutein group (p<0.001), resulting in a 51% decrease from 2.3 \u00b5g/ml at baseline to 1.0 \u00b5g/ml at 12 months. The C5a concentration showed a significant 0.063ng/ml monthly decrease in the lutein group (p<0.001) resulting in a 36% decrease from 2.2ng/ml at baseline to 1.6ng/ml at 12 months. The C3d concentration showed a significant 0.19\u00b5g/ml monthly decrease in the lutein group (p=0.004) that gave rise to a 9% decrease from 15.4\u00b5g/ml at baseline to 14.4\u00b5g/ml at 12 months. In the placebo group we found a significant 0.04 \u00b5g/ml monthly decrease in plasma CFD concentration, whereas no changes were observed for C5a and C3d. Lutein supplementation markedly decreases circulating levels of the complement factors CFD, C5a and C3d levels, which might allow a simple method to control this inflammatory pathway of the innate immune system."}

SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA. METHODS: Cultured human RPE cells (ARPE-19 cell line) that had accumulated A2E were exposed to blue (430 nm +/- 30), green (550 +/- 10 nm), or white (390 to 750 nm) light with and without an IOL in the light path. RESULTS: The blue light-absorbing AcrySof Natural IOL was associated with significant reduction (78% to 82%; P<.01) in the death of A2E-laden RPE that were exposed to blue, white, and green light. The decrease in the incidence of cell death was greater in magnitude than would be expected from the amount of light that was absorbed by the IOL. The considerably smaller declines in cell death observed with the AcrySof, Sensar, ClariFlex, and CeeOn Edge IOLs were likely due to nonspecific reductions in light transmittance. CONCLUSIONS: By absorbing blue light, the AcrySof Natural IOL shields RPE cells that have accumulated the aging lipofuscin fluorophore A2E from the damaging effects of light. A long-term population-based clinical trial would determine whether a blue light-absorbing IOL can reduce the risk for or progression of age-related macular degeneration."}

METHODS: Eighty eyes (60 patients) had implantation of Acrysof toric IOL in our hospital between Oct. 2009 and Sep. 2010. The patients were divided into four groups according to the toric models (T3, T4 and T5). The uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), residual cylinders, contrast sensitivity, high order aberration and IOL axis were evaluated preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. Sixty-five eyes (45 patients) had implantation of Acrysof Natural IOL. RESULTS: The UCVA improved in the toric groups three months postoperatively. The UCVA of group T5b was lower than that of the other three groups. The UCVA of toric group was (0.19 \u00b1 0.14) which was better than that of the control group (t = 4.04, P < 0.05). The residual cylinder was (1.69 \u00b1 0.68) D in group T5b, which was statistically different from the other three groups. The residual cylinder of the toric group was (0.51 \u00b1 0.78) D, which was much lower than the control group (t = 2.54, P < 0.05). The difference of contrast sensitivity between the four toric groups was not statistically significant. The low-order aberration and coma of group T5b was higher than that of the other three groups. The difference of contrast sensitivity between the toric group and the control group was not statistically significant. The low-order aberration and coma of the toric group were lower than those of the control group. The IOLs in 67 eyes (83.75%) rotated less than 5 degrees and all IOLs rotated less than 10 degrees. CONCLUSION: Implantation of the AcrySof toric IOL proves to be an effective, safe, and stable method of managing corneal astigmatism in cataract patients and provides good visual quality."}
{"docid": 14769042, "title": "Selectivity of retinal photoisomerization in proteorhodopsin is controlled by aspartic acid 227.", "text": "Similarly to bacteriorhodopsin, proteorhodopsin that normally contains all-trans and 13-cis retinal is transformed at low pH to a species containing 9-cis retinal under continuous illumination at lambda > 530 nm. This species, absorbing around 430 nm, returns thermally in tens of minutes to initial pigment and can be reconverted also with blue-light illumination. The yield of the 9-cis species is negligibly small at neutral pH but increases manyfold (>100) at acid pH with a pK(a) of 2.6. This indicates that protonation of acidic group(s) alters the photoreaction pathway that leads normally to all-trans --> 13-cis isomerization. In the D97N mutant, in which one of the two acidic groups in the vicinity of the retinal Schiff base is not ionizable, the yield of 9-cis species at low pH shows a pH dependence similar to that in the wild-type but with a somewhat increased pK(a) of 3.3. In contrast to this relatively minor effect, replacement of the other acidic group, Asp227, with Asn results in a remarkable, more than 50-fold, increase in the yield of the light-induced formation of 9-cis species in the pH range 4-6. It appears that protonation of Asp227 at low pH is what causes the dramatic increase in the yield of the 9-cis species in wild-type proteorhodopsin. We conclude that the photoisomerization pathways in proteorhodopsin to 13-cis or 9-cis photoproducts are controlled by the charge state of Asp227."}

Here we review the light oxygen voltage, cryptochrome, and sensors of blue light using FAD families, three different groups of proteins that offer distinctly different modes of photochemical activation and signal transduction yet play similar roles in a vast array of biological responses. We cover mechanisms of light activation and propagation of conformational responses that modulate protein-protein interactions involved in biological signaling.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 2-global-flash mfERG (VERIS\u2122) was recorded (23 control, 34 POAG). Eight recordings were noise contaminated: 4 control, 4 POAG. Response averages from the central 10\u00b0 and 7 surrounding groups were analyzed with and without a 50\u2009Hz digital filter for the following mfERG response epochs: direct component (15-45\u2009ms), 1st (45-75\u2009ms) and 2nd (75-105\u2009ms) induced components. RESULTS: A digital 50\u2009Hz filter had little effect on uncontaminated with noise waveforms but, in noisy recordings, changed the waveform dramatically to resemble uncontaminated waveforms. In controls' 50\u2009Hz-filtered uncontaminated with noise mfERGs differed significantly from unfiltered responses in induced components. Uncontaminated with noise recordings from glaucoma patients did not differ with or without the notch filter (p\u2009>\u20090.1 for all three epochs of mfERG). The mfERG response in the central 10\u00b0in glaucoma patients differed significantly from controls, whether the notch filter was used or not (p\u2009<\u20090.001). CONCLUSIONS: A 50\u2009Hz notch filter allows grossly contaminated waveforms to be analyzed in a meaningful manner. With a 50\u2009Hz filter, glaucoma patients still differed significantly from normal."}

SETTING: Sri Sankaradeva Nethralaya, Guwahati, India. METHODS: This prospective randomized parallel group single-center patient-masked examiner-masked study comprised 26 eyes of 13 healthy patients with bilateral age-related cataract. All patients had cataract surgery by phacoemulsification in both eyes; 1 eye received an AcrySof Natural IOL (SN60AT) and the fellow eye, an AcrySof (SA60AT) IOL. Final postoperative examination was performed at the end of 18 months. In addition to other findings, visual acuity, color perception, and contrast sensitivity were recorded. A group of normal, similarly aged phakic individuals with clear lenses was examined for contrast sensitivity. The records thus obtained were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: The AcrySof and AcrySof Natural IOL groups had a statistically significant improvement in visual acuity and color perception in comparison to preoperative status, and this was maintained until the last postoperative follow-up at 18 months. There was no statistically significant difference in the findings between the 2 IOL groups. The AcrySof and the AcrySof Natural IOL groups showed significant improvement in contrast sensitivity from the preoperative to the postoperative period (both P < .001). However, the AcrySof Natural IOL group was better than the AcrySof IOL group when each group was compared separately to similarly aged phakic individuals with clear lenses. CONCLUSIONS: Pseudophakia following AcrySof Natural SN60AT and AcrySof SA60AT IOL implantation led to equivalent visual acuity and color perception. But the contrast sensitivity in the AcrySof Natural group was better and near normal in reference to a healthy, age-matched control group."}

RESULTS: Values for total and spherical aberrations in the multifocal group were statistically lower than in the monofocal group. In the monofocal group, 75% achieved uncorrected intermediate visual acuities between Jaeger 1 and 6. In the multifocal group, 75% of the eyes achieved more than Jaeger 6. At least 87.5% of the multifocal group and 6.3% of the monofocal group achieved monocular uncorrected near acuity of 20/30 (J2, N5) or better. And 90.0% of the eyes in the multifocal group and 37.5% in the monofocal group achieved an uncorrected near acuity of 20/40 (J3, N6) or better.

MPOD as well as blue light sensitivity in fovea and parafovea were measured monthly by heterochromatic flicker photometry. Average xanthophyll plasma concentrations, analysed monthly by HPLC, increased up to 27-fold. MPOD increased by 15% upon L or L+Z supplementation. Supplementation of Z alone produced similar pigment accumulation in fovea and parafovea, which confounded MPOD measurements. After correction for this, a 14% MPOD increase resulted for Z. Thus, during supplementation with xanthophylls, L is predominantly deposited in the fovea while Z deposition appears to cover a wider retinal area.

The peripapillary RNFL thickness was measured using a Cirrus SD OCT before and 8 weeks after cataract surgery. Perioperative differences in RNFL thickness measurements and signal strengths (SS) were evaluated and compared in both IOL groups. RESULTS: Thirty-nine eyes of 39 patients were included in the final analysis. There was a significant increase in average RNFL thickness and SS after cataract surgery in both IOL groups. No significant difference in perioperative changes of RNFL measurements was noted between yellow and clear IOL groups. In the multivariable analysis, the factor affecting perioperative differences of RNFL measurements was not IOL type but SS. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that blue-light filtering IOL does not influence RNFL thickness measurements by Cirrus SD-OCT."}

Rheopheresis is a safe and effective modality of therapeutic apheresis to treat microcirculatory disorders, and represents a novel therapeutic approach for patients with dry AMD and soft drusen. Elimination of a defined spectrum of high molecular weight proteins from human plasma including pathophysiologically relevant risk factors for AMD such as fibrinogen, LDL-cholesterol, alpha 2-macroglobulin, fibronectin, and von-Willebrand factor results in the reduction of blood and plasma viscosity as well as erythrocyte and thrombocyte aggregation. Pulses of lowering blood and plasma viscosity performed as series of Rheopheresis treatments lead to rapid changes of blood flow, subsequently inducing sustained improvement of microcirculation, and recovery of retinal function. Two controlled randomized clinical trials demonstrated safety and efficacy of Rheopheresis for the treatment of AMD patients, especially with the dry form. Recently the interim-analysis of the sham-controlled, double blinded, randomized multicenter MIRA-I trial confirmed these results. The RheoNet-registry and the development and continuous update of therapy guidelines provide an appropriate framework for the quality management of the interdisciplinary cooperation between ophthalmologists with apheresis specialists. A hypothesis based upon current knowledge of pathogenic mechanisms of the development and progression of AMD can be conclusively linked with the putative mechanism of action of Rheopheresis for AMD. A recommendation for high-risk AMD-patients was defined. Based on the positive results of the MIRA-1 interim analysis eight Rheopheresis treatments are currently recommended as the initial treatment series."}

SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, St. Thomas' Hospital, London, United Kingdom. METHODS: Seventeen square-edged 20.0 diopter IOLs of different manufacture, design, and material were selected. After the environmental scanning electron microscopy technique was standardized, repeatability of the technique was tested. Posterior optic edges of all IOLs were scanned at a magnification of x 500. Local radii of curvature of the posterior optic edges were measured by purpose-designed software. Optic edge thickness was also measured from the electron micrographs. RESULTS: The repeatability of the scanning technique was excellent (+/-0.10 microm). The radius of curvature of posterior optic edges ranged from 7.6 to 23.1 microm. Hydrophilic acrylic IOLs (except the HumanOptics MC Microlens 611 MI-B and 1CU) had radii of curvatures more than 10.0 microm of the posterior optic edge compared with hydrophobic acrylic and silicone IOLs (<10.0 microm) except the Hoya AF-1 (19.9 microm). Alcon AcrySof single-piece (SN60WF), HumanOptics 1CU, and AMO Clariflex CLRFLXC IOLs had the thinnest optic edges in the hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and silicone groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Commercially marketed square-edged IOLs differed in the sharpness of the posterior optic edge. Hydrophobic acrylic and silicone IOLs have sharper posterior optic square edge than most hydrophilic acrylic IOLs. This probably reflects difference in manufacturing techniques. Differences in posterior optic edge profile may explain variation in posterior capsule opacification performance with different IOLs and materials."}

METHODS: Thirty-four patients underwent bilateral implantation of a nontinted multifocal IOL (Alcon ReSTOR), 30 received a yellow-tinted multifocal IOL (ReSTOR Natural), and 17 a monofocal IOL. All-distance VA was measured with an all-distance vision tester at 12 months postoperatively. The relationships between pupillary diameter and IOL decentration and tilt with VA were determined. RESULTS: Both uncorrected and best distance-corrected near VA in the multifocal groups were significantly better than those in the monofocal group, whereas no significant differences were found in far-to-intermediate VAs. There was no significant difference in all-distance VA between the nontinted and yellow-tinted multifocal groups. In the multifocal groups, a larger pupillary diameter was associated with better near VA, whereas there was no correlation between VA and IOL decentration and tilt. CONCLUSIONS: Near VA with a diffractive multifocal IOL was better than that with a monofocal IOL, although far-to-intermediate VAs were similar. All-distance VA with the nontinted multifocal IOL was similar to that with the yellow-tinted multifocal IOL. Larger pupillary diameter was associated with better near VA with the multifocal IOL."}
{"docid": 26233628, "title": "The Effect of Cataract Surgery on Circadian Photoentrainment: A Randomized Trial of Blue-Blocking versus Neutral Intraocular Lenses.", "text": "PURPOSE: Cataract decreases blue light transmission. Because of the selective blue light sensitivity of the retinal ganglion cells governing circadian photoentrainment, cataract may interfere with normal sleep-wake regulation and cause sleep disturbances. The purpose was to investigate the effect of cataract surgery on circadian photoentrainment and to determine any difference between blue-blocking and neutral intraocular lenses (IOLs). DESIGN: The study was a single-center, investigator-driven, double-masked, block-randomized clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: One eye in 76 patients with bilateral age-related cataract eligible for cataract surgery was included. METHODS: Intervention was cataract surgery by phacoemulsification. Patients were randomized to receive a blue-blocking or neutral IOL. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was activation of intrinsic photosensitive ganglion cells using post-illumination pupil response (PIPR) to blue light from 10 to 30 seconds after light exposure as a surrogate measure. Secondary outcomes were circadian rhythm analysis using actigraphy and 24-hour salivary melatonin measurements. Finally, objective and subjective sleep quality were determined by actigraphy and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. RESULTS: The blue light PIPR increased 2 days (17%) and 3 weeks (24%) after surgery (P < 0.001). The majority of circadian and sleep-specific actigraphy parameters did not change after surgery. A forward shift of the circadian rhythm by 22 minutes (P = 0.004) for actigraphy and a tendency toward an earlier melatonin onset (P = 0.095) were found. Peak salivary melatonin concentration increased after surgery (P = 0.037). No difference was detected between blue-blocking and neutral IOLs, whereas low preoperative blue light transmission was inversely associated with an increase in PIPR (P = 0.021) and sleep efficiency (P = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: Cataract surgery increases photoreception by the photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. Because of inconsistency between the significant findings and the many parameters that were unchanged, we can conclude that cataract surgery does not adversely affect the circadian rhythm or sleep. Longer follow-up time and fellow eye surgery may reveal the significance of the subtle changes observed. We found no difference between blue-blocking and neutral IOLs, and, because of the minor effect of surgery in itself, an effect of IOL type seems highly unlikely."}

METHODS: Two hundred eyes of 100 patients with bilateral cataracts were randomly assigned to receive spherical (Acrysof SN60AT [Alcon Laboratories Inc] or Sensar AR40e [Advanced Medical Optics Inc]) or aspheric IOLs (Acrysof SN60WF [Alcon] or Tecnis Z9000 [Advanced Medical Optics]). Ophthalmologic examination, including best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), pupil size, ocular dominance, contrast sensitivity under mesopic and photopic conditions, and wavefront analysis, was performed 2 months and 1 and 2 years after surgery. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences among the four groups in terms of age, pupil diameter, postoperative BSCVA, comeal spherical aberration, and posterior capsular opacification were noted. At all followup examinations, contrast sensitivity results showed no significant differences between the two aspheric IOLs at all spatial frequencies. Under photopic conditions, significant differences (P<.05) between spherical and aspheric IOLs were detected for spatial frequencies of 12 and 18 cycles per degree (cpd) at 2 months and 2 years and 12 cpd at 1 year. Under mesopic conditions, significant differences (P<.05) were detected between spherical and aspheric IOLs for all spatial frequencies at 2 months; all spatial frequencies except 18 cpd at 1 year; and spatial frequencies of 3, 12, and 18 cpd at 2 years. In addition, aspheric IOLs had statistical reductions in total spherical aberration at all follow-up examinations (P<.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that implantation of a modified aspheric IOL improves functional visual performance at 2 years postoperative."}

SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan, and the Department of Ophthalmology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland. DESIGN: Prospective comparative observational study. METHODS: Patients were enrolled who had cataract surgery with implantation of a yellow-tinted or colorless IOL and for whom images were obtained on which the fundus autofluorescence was measurable using the Heidelberg Retina Angiogram 2 postoperatively. The fundus autofluorescence in the images was classified into 8 abnormal patterns based on the classification of the International Fundus Autofluorescence Classification Group, The presence of normal fundus autofluorescence, geographic atrophy, and wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) also was recorded. The fundus findings at baseline and 2 years postoperatively were compared. RESULTS: Fifty-two eyes with a yellow-tinted IOL and 79 eyes with a colorless IOL were included. Abnormal fundus autofluorescence did not develop or increase in the yellow-tinted IOL group; however, progressive abnormal fundus autofluorescence developed or increased in 12 eyes (15.2%) in the colorless IOL group (P = .0016). New drusen, geographic atrophy, and choroidal neovascularization were observed mainly in the colorless IOL group. The incidence of AMD was statistically significantly higher in the colorless IOL group (P = .042). CONCLUSIONS: Two years after cataract surgery, significant differences were seen in the progression of abnormal fundus autofluorescence between the 2 groups. The incidence of AMD was lower in eyes with a yellow-tinted IOL. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE: No author has a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned."}

SETTING: Medical University of Vienna, Department of Ophthalmology, Vienna, Austria. METHODS: Randomized implantation of an AF-1 (UV) IOL (Hoya) in 1 eye and an AF-1 (UY) IOL (Hoya) in the contralateral eye was performed after phacoemulsification and primary posterior curvilinear capsulorhexis. Three months postoperatively, the best distance-corrected visual acuity was evaluated. Before color contrast sensitivity testing, a heterochromatic flicker test was performed in both eyes to avoid error in brightness matching. Central and peripheral tritan color contrast sensitivities were evaluated using the Moorfields Vision System (CH Electronics). RESULTS: Visual acuity did not differ significantly between the 2 IOL groups (P>.05). The central color contrast sensitivity threshold also did not differ significantly between eyes with a clear IOL and eyes with a yellow IOL at any tested spatial frequency. The peripheral color contrast sensitivity test showed slightly higher color contrast sensitivity thresholds in eyes with a yellow IOL, although the differences were not statistically significant. Two patients independently reported subjective changes in color perception in the eye with the yellow IOL. CONCLUSION: In this intraindividual comparison, the implantation of a blue-light-filtering IOL did not lead to a clinically significant change in color contrast sensitivity."}
{"docid": 18320254, "title": "Zeaxanthin is bioavailable from genetically modified zeaxanthin-rich potatoes.", "text": "The carotenoid zeaxanthin accumulates in the human macula lutea and protects retinal cells from blue light damage. However, zeaxanthin intake from food sources is low. Increasing zeaxanthin in common foods such as potatoes by traditional plant breeding or by genetic engineering could contribute to an increased intake of this carotenoid and, consequently, to a decreased risk of age-related macular degeneration. Our aim was to investigate whether zeaxanthin from genetically modified zeaxanthin-rich potatoes is bioavailable in humans. Three men participated in this randomized, controlled double-blinded, crossover pilot study. All subjects consumed 1,100 g of mashed potatoes, either genetically modified (Solanum tuberosum L. var. Baltica GM47/18; 3 mg zeaxanthin) or wild-type control potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L. var. Baltica; 0.14 mg zeaxanthin). A second treatment was followed after a 7-day wash-out period. The concentration of zeaxanthin was significantly increased in chylomicrons after consumption of genetically modified potatoes and 0.27 mg of the 3 mg zeaxanthin dose could be detected in chylomicrons. Consumption of control potatoes had no effect on concentrations of zeaxanthin in chylomicrons. After normalization of chylomicron zeaxanthin for plasma triacylglycerol, the time course of zeaxanthin concentrations peaked at 7 h after consumption of genetically modified potatoes. There were no significant differences in the concentrations of other major potato carotenoids such as lutein and beta-carotene in chylomicrons after consumption of genetically modified and wild type control potatoes. Thus, consumption of zeaxanthin-rich potatoes significantly increases chylomicron zeaxanthin concentrations suggesting that potentially such potatoes could be used as an important dietary source of zeaxanthin."}

DESIGN: Randomized prospective study. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred twenty eyes of 60 patients with bilateral cataract implanted with 3 IOL models (AcrySof IQ, AcrySof SN60AT [Alcon Laboratories, Fort Worth, TX], and Sensar AR40 [Allergan Surgical, Irvine, CA]). METHODS: Pupil diameter was analyzed by using a Colvard pupillometer (OASIS Medical, Inc., Glendora, CA) under photopic, mesopic, and scotopic conditions. Distance (6 m), intermediate (1 m), and near (0.33 m) visual acuities were measured with distance correction in place 90 days after surgery. Wavefront analysis (LadarWave; Alcon Laboratories) was performed using 5-mm and measured photopic pupil diameter at 30 and 90 days after surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To evaluate spherical aberration and depth of focus (by means of distance-corrected near and intermediate visual acuity) in patients implanted with aspheric and spherical IOLs. RESULTS: Photopic pupil sizes in each group were similar at 30 days after surgery. At 90 days after surgery, mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution distance-corrected near visual acuity (+/-standard deviation [SD]) was 0.50+/-0.20 in the AcrySof IQ group, 0.38+/-0.17 in the AcrySof SN60AT group, and 0.45+/-0.16 in Sensar AR40 group. Mean spherical aberration values (+/-SD) were 0.03+/-0.05 microm in the AcrySof IQ group, 0.24+/-0.04 microm in the AcrySof SN60AT group, and 0.14+/-0.07 microm in the Sensar AR40 group. The AcrySof IQ group showed a statistically significant lower induction of spherical aberration and worse distance-corrected near visual acuity. The AcrySof SN60AT group showed statistically significant higher mean spherical aberration values and better distance-corrected near and intermediate visual acuity. CONCLUSIONS: The reduction of total spherical aberration after aspheric IOL implantation may degrade distance-corrected near and intermediate visual acuity."}
{"docid": 10809448, "title": "Tomato contains homologues of Arabidopsis cryptochromes 1 and 2.", "text": "Cryptochromes are blue light photoreceptors found in both plants and animals. They probably evolved from photolyases, which are blue/UV-light-absorbing photoreceptors involved in DNA repair. In seed plants, two different cryptochrome (CRY) genes have been found in Arabidopsis and one in Sinapis, while three genes have been found in the fern Adiantum. We report the characterisation of tomato CRY genes CRY1 and CRY2. They map to chromosomes 4 and 9, respectively, show relatively constitutive expression and encode proteins of 679 and 635 amino acids, respectively. These proteins show higher similarity to their Arabidopsis counterparts than to each other, suggesting that duplication between CRY1 and CRY2 is an ancient event in the evolution of seed plants. The seed plant cryptochromes form a group distinct from the fern cryptochromes, implying that only one gene was present in the common ancestor between these two groups of plants. Most intron positions in CRY genes from plants and ferns are highly conserved. Tomato cryl and cry2 proteins carry C-terminal domains 210 and 160 amino acids long, respectively. Several conserved motifs are found in these domains, some of which are common to both types of cryptochromes, while others are cryptochrome-type-specific."}

METHODS: Fifteen patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), 19 patients with optic nerve disease (ON), and 16 healthy subjects were enrolled in this prospective study. ON included optic neuritis (NNO) and non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). For each subject, the PLR was recorded, to red, yellow, green, and blue stimuli for durations of 4 and 12\u00a0s, and for stimulus intensities of 4\u00a0lx and 28\u00a0lx. RESULTS: Comparison between control and RP or ON patient results showed that responses after stimulus onset were significantly different for most stimulus conditions, but the post-stimulus amplitudes at 3\u00a0s and 7\u00a0s after light extinction were not. On the other hand, the difference between the ON and RP groups was significant only for post-stimuli time-points and only for blue stimuli. Differences between responses to blue and red were significantly different, predominantly at post stimulus time-points. A ROC analysis revealed that the maximal constriction amplitudes to a 4\u00a0lx, 4\u00a0s yellow stimulus are significantly different in ON vs RP patients, and the responses to a 4\u00a0s, 28\u00a0lx blue stimulus at 7\u00a0s post-stimulus are significantly different in controls vs ON vs RP patients with a high specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Pupillary light responses to blue light in healthy, RP, and ON subjects are significantly different from one another. The optimal stimuli for future protocols was found to be a 4\u00a0s blue stimulus at 28\u00a0lx, and a 4\u00a0s yellow stimulus at 4\u00a0lx."}

DESIGN: Experimental study in animal and human donor eyes. METHODS: Thirteen dyes, methyl violet, crystal violet, eosin Y, sudan black B, methylene blue, toluidine blue, light green, indigo carmine, fast green, congo red, evans blue, brilliant blue, and bromophenol blue, were injected onto the LC and ILM of enucleated porcine eyes. The vitreous was stained with 2 mL of dyes for 1 minute. Six dyes (indigo carmine, evans blue, fast green, light green, bromophenol blue, and brilliant blue) were selected for experiments in human donor eyes and freshly removed ERM. RESULTS: In the porcine eyes, ILM staining with methylene blue, toluidine blue, indigo carmine, evans blue, bromophenol blue, and fast green was moderate, and methyl violet, crystal violet, brilliant blue, or sudan black resulted in strong staining. Methyl violet, crystal violet, sudan black, toluidine blue, and methylene blue caused histologic damage in porcine retinas. Vitreous examination revealed moderate staining with congo red, crystal violet, fast green, eosin Y, methylene blue, toluidine blue, brilliant blue, bromophenol blue, and methyl violet and strong staining with light green and evans blue. ERMs showed strong staining with 0.5% evans blue and moderate staining with 0.5% light green, fast green, brilliant blue, and bromophenol blue. Evaluation of donor eyes disclosed moderate staining with evans blue, light green, and bromophenol blue and strong staining with 0.5% brilliant blue. Moderate or strong staining of the vitreous occurred with most dyes. LC evaluation showed moderate staining with 0.5% evans blue, fast green, and brilliant blue, whereas 0.5% light green produced strong LC staining. CONCLUSIONS: Brilliant blue shows the best ILM staining, whereas bromophenol blue, evans blue, and light green also stain ILM. Most dyes bind well to LC, vitreous, and ERM."}

SETTING: Storm Eye Institute, Charleston, South Carolina, USA; Iladevi Cataract and IOL Research Center, Ahmedabad, India. DESIGN: Cohort study. METHODS: Medical records of patients younger than 1 year who had primary posterior capsulectomy, vitrectomy, and in-the-bag hydrophobic acrylic IOL implantation were reviewed. In bilateral cases, 1 eye was randomly chosen. The need for surgery for visually significant VAO was evaluated 12 months after cataract surgery. RESULTS: Seventy-two eyes were included. The mean age at cataract surgery was 6.0 months. Seventeen eyes (23.6%) required surgery for VAO a mean of 6.2 \u00b1 2.9 months postoperatively. The odds for VAO surgery were 3.5 times greater in eyes of female children than in eyes of male children. For AcrySof MA60AC, SA60AT, SN60AT, or SN60WF IOLs, surgery for VAO was required in 25%, 23%, 23%, and 23% of eyes, respectively.
