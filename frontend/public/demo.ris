AB  - PURPOSE: We quantitatively characterized the space between the IOL and the 
      posterior capsule (IOL-PC space) during the early postphacoemulsification period, 
      using high resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT). METHODS: We recruited 
      30 eyes of 30 patients who underwent phacoemulsification and randomly divided 
      them into two groups. Acrysof Natural IQ IOLs were implanted in one group (n = 
      15), and Adapt-AO IOLs were implanted into the other (n = 15). A custom-built OCT 
      instrument was used to image the IOL-PC space at 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month after 
      surgery. Slit-lamp examination and auto refraction were performed at each visit. 
      RESULTS: The IOL-PC spaces in the IQ group were 0.72 ± 0.35, 0.40 ± 0.24, and 
      0.23 ± 0.16 mm(2) at 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month after surgery, respectively. At 
      each of these times, the values for the AO group were significantly smaller (P < 
      0.001). Compared to 1 day after surgery, significant changes in the ACDs and 
      refractive errors occurred up to 1 month postoperatively in the IQ group; 
      however, changes in the ACD and refractive error were significant only at 1 week 
      in the AO group. CONCLUSIONS: The decreases in IOL-PC space and in ACD during the 
      early postoperative period were associated with a myopic shift. It appeared that 
      the different IOL designs had a role in closure of the IOL-PC space. High 
      resolution OCT was suitable for quantitative analysis of IOL-PC space.

PG  - 1135-41
LID - 10.1016/j.jcrs.2010.01.021 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the natural history of focal collections (islands) of lens 
      epithelial cells (LECs) on the posterior capsule after cataract surgery. SETTING: 
      Department of Ophthalmology, St. Thomas' Hospital, London, United Kingdom. 
      METHODS: Patients in previous studies with various intraocular lenses (IOLs) and 
      at least a 2-year follow-up were identified. Postoperative digital 
      retroillumination images of each eye taken at 1, 3, and 6 months and 1 and 2 
      years were assessed for the presence of LEC islands and their incidence, 
      etiology, time of appearance, change with time, and relationship to IOL material. 
      RESULTS: Islands of LECs were identified in 39 eyes with an AcrySof SA60AT IOL, 
      40 eyes with a Rayner Centerflex C570H IOL, and 27 eyes with a Hoya YA60BB IOL. 
      In all groups, the islands tended to appear within 6 months with a decreasing 
      incidence thereafter. Floating LECs that seeded on the posterior capsule (seeded 
      LECs) or LECs left on the posterior capsule at surgery were seen in a small 
      number of eyes. Most islands were derived from regression of a previous LEC 
      membrane, and a majority continued to regress. Intraocular lens material had no 
      influence on the natural history or morphology of the islands. CONCLUSION: 
      Islands of LECs were common postoperatively. Equatorial LECs appeared to be the 
      major cause of clinical posterior capsule opacification (PCO). Floating LECs in 
      the aqueous that seeded on the posterior capsule or LECs left behind after 
      surgery did not appear to contribute to clinical PCO. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE: No

TI  - New light for old eyes: comparing melanopsin-mediated non-visual benefits of 
      blue-light and UV-blocking intraocular lenses.
PG  - 124-8
LID - 10.1136/bjophthalmol-2013-304024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Melanopsin-expressing photosensitive retinal ganglion cells form 
      a blue-light-sensitive non-visual system mediating diverse physiological effects 
      including circadian entrainment and cognitive alertness. Reduced blue wavelength 
      retinal illumination through cataract formation is thought to blunt these 
      responses while cataract surgery and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation have 
      been shown to have beneficial effects on sleep and cognition. We aimed to use the 
      reaction time (RT) task and the Epworth Sleepiness Score (ESS) as a validated 
      objective platform to compare non-visual benefits of UV- and blue-blocking IOLs. 
      METHODS: Patients were prospectively randomised to receive either a UV- or 
      blue-blocking IOL, performing an RT test and ESS questionnaire before and after 
      surgery. Optical blurring at the second test controlled for visual improvement. 
      Non-operative age-matched controls were recruited for comparison. RESULTS: 80 
      participants completed the study. Those undergoing first-eye phacoemulsification 
      demonstrated significant improvements in RT over control (p=0.001) and second-eye 
      surgery patients (p=0.03). Moreover, reduced daytime sleepiness was measured by 
      ESS for the first-eye surgery group (p=0.008) but not for the second-eye group 
      (p=0.09). Choice of UV- or blue-blocking IOL made no significant difference to 
      magnitude of cognitive improvement (p=0.272). CONCLUSIONS: Phacoemulsification, 
      particularly first-eye surgery, has a strong positive effect on cognition and 
      daytime alertness, regardless of IOL type.

TI  - Blue light-filtering intraocular lenses and post-operative mood: a pilot clinical 
      study.
PG  - 249-56
LID - 10.1007/s10792-014-9944-6 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine if implantation of blue-filtering 
      intraocular lenses (IOLs) affects post-operative mood, inducing more depression, 
      compared to patients undergoing implantation with conventional IOLs. The study 
      was conducted at the Angers University Hospital, France. This was a prospective 
      with a lowercase pilot study, including consecutive patients planned to undergo 
      cataract surgery in both eyes within 1 week. The same type of IOL was used in 
      both eyes of each patient. The choice of IOL was not randomized but driven by the 
      habits and experience of each participating surgeon. Cognitively healthy patients 
      (an MMSE score higher than 25) were assessed before and after surgery, using the 
      30-item geriatric depression scale (GDS) to seek symptoms of depression. 
      Univariate and multiple logistic regressions were used to examine the association 
      between the type of IOL and the 30-item GDS score improvement during the 3 months 
      after lens implantation, while adjusting for participants' characteristics (age, 
      visual acuity). Blue-filtering IOLs were used in 16 patients (mean ± standard 
      deviation, 75.6 ± 7.5 years; 75 % female), and untinted IOLs in 18 patients 
      (77.3 ± 6.9 years; 77.8 %female). Pre-operatively visual acuity and GDS scores 
      were comparable in the two groups. The post-operative GDS score was improved by 
      1.91 ± 3.10 points in the whole sample (P = 0.002), as well as in each subgroup 
      of patients. Three months after surgery, the mean change in GDS score did not 
      differ between groups (P = 0.365), nor did the mean visual acuity (P = 0.198).

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess visual field (VF) defects and retinal function objectively in 
      healthy participants and patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) using a 
      chromatic multifocal pupillometer. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: 
      The right eyes of 16 healthy participants and 13 RP patients. METHODS: Pupil 
      responses to red and blue light (peak, 485 and 625 nm, respectively) presented by 
      76 light-emitting diodes, 1.8-mm spot size at different locations of a 16.2° VF 
      were recorded. Subjective VFs of RP patients were determined using chromatic 
      dark-adapted Goldmann VFs (CDA-GVFs). Six healthy participants underwent 2 
      pupillometer examinations to determine test-retest reliability. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: Three parameters of pupil contraction were determined automatically: 
      percentage of change of pupil size (PPC), maximum contraction velocity (MCV; in 
      pixels per second), and latency of MCV (LMCV; in seconds). The fraction of 
      functional VF was determined by CDA-GVF. RESULTS: In healthy participants, higher 
      PPC and MCV were measured in response to blue compared with red light. The LMCV 
      in response to blue light was relatively constant throughout the VF. Healthy 
      participants demonstrated higher PPC and MCV and shorter LMCV in central compared 
      with peripheral test points in response to red light. Test-retest correlation 
      coefficients were 0.7 for PPC and 0.5 for MCV. In RP patients, test point in 
      which the PPC and MCV were lower than 4 standard errors from the mean of healthy 
      participants correlated with areas that were indicated as nonseeing by CDA-GVF. 
      The mean absolute deviation in LMCV parameter in response to the red light 
      between different test point was significantly higher in RP patients (range, 
      0.16-0.47) than in healthy participants (range, 0.02-0.16; P < 0.0001) and 
      indicated its usefulness as a diagnostic tool with high sensitivity and 
      specificity (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 0.97, 
      Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon analysis). Randomly reducing the number of test points to a 
      total of 15 points did not significantly reduce the AUC in RP diagnosis based on 
      this parameter. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using a 
      chromatic multifocal pupillometer for objective diagnosis of RP and assessment of 
      VF defects.

AB  - PURPOSE: To identify disease-specific changes in Stargardt disease (STGD) based 
      on imaging with polarization-sensitive spectral-domain optical coherence 
      tomography (PS-OCT) and to compare structural changes with those visible on blue 
      light fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging. METHODS: Twenty-eight eyes of 14 
      patients diagnosed with STGD were imaged using a novel high-speed, large-field 
      PS-OCT system and FAF (excitation 488 nm, emission > 500 nm). The ophthalmoscopic 
      phenotype was classified into three groups. ABCA4 mutation testing detected 15 
      STGD alleles, six of which harbor novel mutations. RESULTS: STGD phenotype 1 (12 
      eyes) showed sharply delineated areas of absent RPE signal on RPE segmentation 
      B-scans of PS-OCT correlating with areas of hypofluorescence on FAF. Adjacent 
      areas of irregular fluorescence correlated with an irregular RPE segmentation 
      line with absence of overlaying photoreceptor layers. Eyes characterized on OCT 
      by a gap in the subfoveal outer segment layer (foveal cavitation) showed a normal 
      RPE segmentation line on PS-OCT. Hyperfluorescent flecks on FAF in phenotype 2 
      STGD (8 eyes) were identified as clusters of depolarizing material at the level 
      of the RPE. Distribution of flecks could be depicted on RPE elevation maps. An 
      increased amount of depolarizing material in the choroid was characteristic for 
      STGD Phenotype 3 (8 eyes). CONCLUSIONS: PS-OCT together with FAF identified 
      characteristic patterns of changes in different stages of the disease. PS-OCT is 
      a promising new tool for diagnosis and evaluation of future treatment modalities 
      in STGD.

TI  - Effect of the AcrySof Natural intraocular lens on blue-yellow perimetry.
PG  - 1328-30
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the differences in blue-yellow perimetry values in patients 
      with an AcrySof Natural intraocular lens (IOL) in 1 eye and a conventional 
      AcrySof IOL in the fellow eye. SETTING: Cataract and glaucoma clinics of a 
      medical school associated with a public hospital in Brazil. METHODS: Forty-six 
      patients had bilateral phacoemulsification and implantation of an AcrySof SN60AT 
      IOL (Alcon) in 1 eye and an MA30AC IOL (Alcon) in the fellow eye. Blue-yellow 
      perimetry was performed in both eyes, and the data were analyzed in blinded 
      fashion using the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: No statistically significant 
      differences were observed in short-wavelength automated perimetry (SWAP) values 
      between the 2 IOLs. CONCLUSION: There was no interference by the yellow filter of 
      the AcrySof Natural IOL in blue-yellow perception as determined by SWAP.

TI  - A possible change of refractive index with age and its relevance to chromatic 
      aberration.
PG  - 159-67
AB  - The Purkinje-Sanson images of the eyes were photographed in red and blue light in 
      two groups of subjects, young (19-38 years) and old (52-63 years). Densitometric 
      examination of the negatives showed a significant increase in the amount of red 
      light and a significant decrease in the amount of blue light reflected from the 
      anterior surface of the lens (third image) in the group of old subjects as 
      compared to the group of young persons. There is also a significant decline in 
      the blue light reflected from the posterior surface of the lens (fourth image) 
      but no change in the red light in old versus young eyes. From these results it is 
      suggested that the index of refraction of the lens increases for red (nC) and 
      decreases for blue light (nF) in the aging eye and similarly the index of the 
      vitreous varies differentially in blue and red light. These specific changes in 
      the indices of the lens and vitreous are believed to account for the large 
      decline of axial chromatic aberration of the aging eye. In addition, the 
      examination of the first Purkinje-Sanson image tends to indicate that the index 
      of refraction of the cornea does not vary with age.

TI  - Clinicopathologic study after submacular removal of choroidal neovascular 
      membranes treated with verteporfin ocular photodynamic therapy.
PG  - 343-50
AB  - PURPOSE: To report the clinicopathologic findings after submacular removal of 
      choroidal neovascular membranes (CNV) treated with verteporfin ocular 
      photodynamic therapy. DESIGN: Interventional case series. METHODS: Retrospective 
      review of eight eyes of eight patients who underwent submacular surgery for CNV 
      after having previously received verteporfin ocular photodynamic therapy for 
      presumed ocular histoplasmosis (one patient), age-related macular degeneration 
      ([AMD] three patients) pathologic myopia (two patients), punctate inner 
      choroiditis (one patient), and idiopathic CNV (one patient). All cases had 
      undergone ocular photodynamic therapy with verteporfin using standard protocols. 
      Six of eight patients suffered a submacular hemorrhage after ocular photodynamic 
      therapy, and two of eight patients refused further ocular photodynamic therapy. 
      All patients subsequently had submacular surgery with removal of the CNV. One 
      membrane was routinely processed, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and 
      eosin. Five membranes were stained with toluidine blue for light microscopic 
      examination. Semithin (1.0 microm) sections were cut and stained with uranyl 
      acetate-lead citrate for transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: Choroidal 
      neovascular membranes were removed at 3 days (presumed ocular histoplasmosis), 29 
      days (punctate inner choroiditis), 63 days (AMD, pathologic myopia), 66 days 
      (AMD), 107 days (pathologic myopia), 116 days (AMD), and 152 days (idiopathic) 
      after verteporfin ocular photodynamic therapy. Histopathologic and 
      ultrastructural examination showed areas of vascular occlusion at 3 days that 
      were not seen at later time points. All specimens had patent CNV. There were 
      signs of vascular damage with extravasated erythrocytes and fibrin, pigment 
      clumping in cells, and inflammatory cells in all but the 3-day specimen. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This case series presents data only from patients who refused repeat 
      treatment with ocular photodynamic therapy or who developed submacular hemorrhage 
      after initial photodynamic therapy. Histopathologic evaluation of CNV 3 days 
      after verteporfin ocular photodynamic therapy showed partial vascular occlusion 
      that was not present in later specimens. These later specimens demonstrated 
      evidence of vascular damage. Verteporfin ocular photodynamic therapy does not 
      appear to lead to permanent and complete occlusion of the CNV. Thus, treatments 
      that lead to permanent closure of CNV without damage to the retinal pigment 
      epithelium and sensory retina are still needed.

TI  - Influence of blue-light-filtering intraocular lenses on color perception and 
      contrast acuity.
PG  - 39-45
LID - 10.1016/j.ophtha.2008.08.035 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare contrast acuity at different illumination levels and color 
      vision and the subjective impression in patients after bilateral cataract surgery 
      with a mixed implantation of a blue-light-filtering and an ultraviolet 
      (UV)-filtering intraocular lens (IOL). DESIGN: Randomized, controlled, 
      double-masked, and bilateral study with intraindividual comparison. PARTICIPANTS: 
      This study included 48 eyes of 24 consecutive patients with age-related cataract. 
      METHODS: Each patient had standardized small incision cataract surgery with IOL 
      implantation into the capsular bag. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a 
      blue-light-filtering Hoya AF-1 (UY) YA-60BB IOL in one eye and a UV-filtering 
      Hoya AF-1 (UV) VA-60BB IOL (Hoya Medical Europe, Frankfurt/Main, Germany) in the 
      contralateral eye. Contrast acuity was measured at illumination levels of 500, 5, 
      and 0.5 lux and contrast levels of 100%, 50%, 25%, 12.5%, and 6.25%. Color vision 
      was assessed using the Lanthony desaturated D-15 test, the Lanthony new color 
      test (Munsell chroma 2 and 4), and an anomaloscope. Blue/yellow foveal threshold 
      was tested applying short-wave automated perimetry. The subjective visual 
      impression of patients was evaluated using a questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: Contrast acuity, color vision, and foveal threshold. RESULTS: The 
      blue-light-filtering IOLs had worse contrast acuity (P = 0.0004) and foveal 
      threshold (P = 0.008) compared with the UV-filtering IOLs. Color vision tests and 
      high-contrast visual acuity did not show any statistically significant 
      differences between IOLs (P>0.05). On questioning, 3 of 24 patients noticed a 
      difference between the implanted IOLs concerning visual impression. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study shows that blue-light-filtering IOLs negatively affect contrast acuity 
      and blue/yellow foveal threshold when compared with UV-filtering IOLs. Although 
      the differences were small, the results suggest bilateral implantation of the 
      same IOL type and avoidance of a mixed implantation of a blue-light-filtering IOL 
      in one and a non-blue-light-filtering IOL in the contralateral eye in patients 
      with high demands in color vision. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): The author(s) have no

TI  - Lutein and zeaxanthin supplementation reduces photooxidative damage and modulates 
      the expression of inflammation-related genes in retinal pigment epithelial cells.

AB  - Oxidative damage and inflammation are related to the pathogenesis of age-related 
      macular degeneration (AMD). Epidemiologic studies suggest that insufficient 
      dietary lutein and zeaxanthin intake or lower serum zeaxanthin levels are 
      associated with increased risk for AMD. The objective of this work is to test the 
      protective effects of lutein and zeaxanthin against photooxidative damage to 
      retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) and oxidation-induced changes in 
      expression of inflammation-related genes. To mimic lipofuscin-mediated 
      photooxidation in vivo, we used ARPE-19 cells that accumulated A2E, a lipofuscin 
      fluorophore and photosensitizer, as a model system to investigate the effects of 
      lutein and zeaxanthin supplementation. The data show that supplementation with 
      lutein or zeaxanthin in the medium resulted in accumulation of lutein or 
      zeaxanthin in the RPE cells. The concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin in the 
      cells were 2- to 14-fold of that detected in the medium, indicating that ARPE-19 
      cells actively take up lutein or zeaxanthin. As compared with untreated cells, 
      exposure of A2E-containing RPE to blue light resulted in a 40-60% decrease in 
      proteasome activity, a 50-80% decrease in expression of CFH and MCP-1, and 
      an~20-fold increase in expression of IL-8. The photooxidation-induced changes in 
      expression of MCP-1, IL-8, and CFH were similar to those caused by chemical 
      inhibition of the proteasome, suggesting that inactivation of the proteasome is 
      involved in the photooxidation-induced alteration in expression of these 
      inflammation-related genes. Incubation of the A2E-containing RPE with lutein or 
      zeaxanthin prior to blue light exposure significantly attenuated the 
      photooxidation-induced inactivation of the proteasome and photooxidation-induced 
      changes in expression of MCP-1, IL-8, and CFH. Together, these data indicate that 
      lutein or zeaxanthin modulates inflammatory responses in cultured RPE in response 
      to photooxidation. Protecting the proteasome from oxidative inactivation appears 
      to be one of the mechanisms by which lutein and zeaxanthin modulate the 
      inflammatory response. Similar mechanisms may explain salutary effects of lutein 
      and zeaxanthin in reducing the risk for AMD.

      implantation.
PG  - 856-8
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of intraocular lens (IOL) color on frequency 
      doubling technology (FDT). DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. METHODS: For 26 
      eyes of 26 patients, FDT perimetry (24-2-threshold test) was measured three 
      months after cataract surgery. An acrylic IOL was randomly selected from clear 
      (VA60BB, HOYA) and yellow-tinted lenses (YA60BB, HOYA), which only differed by 
      color. As a control, a further 14 cataractous eyes with visual acuity > or =20/30 
      were examined. We analyzed mean deviation (MD) and pattern standard deviation 
      (PSD) among the three groups. RESULTS: After cataract surgery, MD significantly 
      improved (Fisher protected least significant difference (PLSD): P < .05), but PSD 
      did not change (analysis of variance (ANOVA): P = .94) compared with control 
      values. There was no significant difference between the two IOLs for either MD 
      (Mann-Whitney test; P = .15) or PSD (Mann-Whitney test; P = .84). CONCLUSIONS: 
      When interpreting the results of FDT, the effect of cataract should be considered 
      but that of IOL color does not need consideration.

TI  - [Aberrometry and contrast sensitivity after cataract surgery: aspherical IOL 
      evaluation].
PG  - 257-62
AB  - PURPOSE: We report a prospective clinical study investigating efficacy in terms 
      of aberrometry and contrast sensitivity of the aspherical IOL (SW60AT) versus the 
      standard IOL Alcon (SN60AT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients in each group 
      underwent phacoemulsification of both eyes. Both eyes of each patient received an 
      aspherical IOL (SW60AT) or a similar standard IOL (SN60AT). The integrity of 
      ocular function was assessed with clinical examination before surgery. 
      Postoperative examination (1 month after the second surgery) included best visual 
      acuity, an aberrometry with a 5-mm pupil (Bausch and Lomb), and a contrast vision 
      (Zalonghi scale) in scotopic place examination. RESULTS: We noted no 
      statistically significant difference between the two groups before surgery. Best 
      spectacle-corrected visual acuity improved in both groups with no difference 
      (8.15/10+/-1.39/10 and 7.95/10+/-1.54/10 for the aspheric group eyes and 
      7.85/10+/-2.13/10 and 7.60/10+/-2.14/10 for the standard group eyes). Otherwise, 
      a statistically significant difference was found for the Z40 aberration with 
      RMS=0.0095 with SW60AT versus RMS=0.07625 with SN60AT. The pupils had a similar 
      size in both groups. There were no statistically significant differences for 
      contrast sensitivity between two IOLs; nevertheless, contrast vision seemed to be 
      better with the aspherical lens (33.15+/-6.85 points and 32.15+/-6.95 points for 
      the standard group eyes and 36.05+/-3.63 points and 35.70+/-3.93/10 points for 
      the aspheric eyes). CONCLUSION: The quality of vision can be objectively 
      increased with the aspherical IOL because of less spherical aberration.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To obverse visual acuity, visual symptom and the rate of spectacle 
      independence after implantation of a multifocal intraocular lens (MIOL) in 
      patients with age related cataract. METHODS: Sixty patients (68 eyes) with 
      age-related cataract were enrolled in two groups. ReSTOR SA60D3 MIOL and Natural 
      SN60AT monofocal intraocular lens were specially implanted after 
      phacoemulsification. Uncorrected distance visual acuity (UCDVA), best-corrected 
      distance visual acuity (BCDVA), uncorrected near visual acuity (UCNVA), 
      best-corrected near visual acuity (BCNVA), distance-corrected near vision acuity 
      (DCNVA), visual symptom and the rate of spectacle independence were observed. 
      RESULTS: UCDVA and BCDVA in multifocal group were not statistically different 
      from those in monofocal group (P > 0.05). UCNVA and DCNVA were statistically 
      better in multifocal group than in monofocal group (P < 0.05). The multifocal 
      group has higher rate of spectacle independence than the monofocal group (73.3% 
      versus 13.3%) (P < 0.05) when reading. The visual symptom such as glare and halo 
      were more serious in multifocal group than in monofocal group (P < 0.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Acrysof ReSTOR apodized diffractive multifocal intraocular lens may 
      provide an excellent distance and near visual acuity, and decrease the dependence 
      of spectacle.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare contrast acuity at different illumination levels, color 
      vision, and the subjective visual impression in patients after bilateral cataract 
      surgery with mixed implantation of a yellow-tinted intraocular lens (IOL) and an 
      orange-tinted IOL. SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Hietzing Hospital, 
      Vienna, Austria. DESIGN: Prospective case series. METHODS: Consecutive patients 
      with age-related cataract had standardized small-incision cataract surgery with 
      IOL implantation in the capsular bag. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 
      a yellow Polylens Y30 in 1 eye and an Orange Series model PC 440Y in the 
      contralateral eye. The main outcome measures were contrast acuity, color vision, 
      and subjective visual impression. Contrast acuity was measured at illumination 
      levels of 5.0 lux and 0.5 lux and contrast levels of 50.0%, 25.0%, and 12.5%. 
      Color vision was assessed using the Heidelberg-multicolor anomaloscope, and the 
      subjective visual impression was evaluated using a questionnaire. RESULTS: This 
      study included 64 eyes of 32 patients. The intraindividual comparison showed no 
      significant difference in contrast sensitivity at different contrast and 
      illumination levels or in color vision. On questioning, 3 patients reported a 
      difference in subjective color perception between the 2 IOL types. CONCLUSION: 
      There were no differences in contrast sensitivity or color vision between 
      yellow-tinted IOLs and orange-tinted IOLs. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE: No author has a

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of yellow tinted intraocular lenses (IOLs), 
      implanted in the bag after phacoemulsification, on the result of frequency 
      doubling technique (FDT) perimetry. METHODS: For 68 eyes of 52 patients, an IOL 
      was implanted in the bag after phacoemulsification. The patients were categorized 
      into three groups according to the type of implanted IOLs used. IOLs were 
      selected randomly among two types of yellow IOLs (Acrysof SN60WF IOL, Hoya 
      YA60BBR IOL) and a clear IOL was used as a control. A FDT Humphrey matrix was 
      performed 2 months after the surgery. The mean deviation (MD) and pattern 
      standard deviation (PSD) among these three groups was analyzed using Mann-Whitney 
      U-test. RESULTS: TWO MONTHS AFTER THE PROCEDURE, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT 
      DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EACH OF THE THREE GROUPS: the clear IOL and Hoya YA60BBR IOL 
      (MD, p = 0.21; PSD, p = 0.27), the clear IOL and Alcon SN60WF IOL (MD, p = 0.11; 
      PSD, p = 0.22), and the Hoya YA60BBR IOL and Alcon SN60WF IOL (MD, p = 0.33; PSD, 
      p = 0.56). CONCLUSIONS: When interpreting the result of the FDT after cataract 
      surgery, the color and type of IOLs used should not be considered.

TI  - Comparing the contrast sensitivity of a modified prolate anterior surface IOL and 
      of two spherical IOLs.
PG  - 49-58
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the contrast sensitivity of an intraocular lens (IOL) with a 
      modified prolate anterior surface (Tecnis Z9000, Pfizer), with 2 standard 
      spherical IOLs (Sensar AR40e Opti-Edge IOL, AMO and AcrySof Natural SN60AT IOL, 
      Alcon). METHODS: In this prospective study, 98 eyes of 71 patients received 1 of 
      3 IOLs at random. After 6 months, best corrected visual acuity, pupil size and 
      contrast sensitivity under mesopic and photopic conditions were measured. 
      RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in preoperative and 
      postoperative refractive error and best corrected visual acuity existed between 
      the groups. When comparing the Tecnis IOL with the AR40e IOL, contrast 
      sensitivity testing showed significantly better results in the Tecnis group at 3 
      and 12 cpd in photopic conditions; at 3, 12 and 18 cpd in photopic with glare; at 
      3, 12 and 18 cpd in mesopic and at 12 and 18 cpd in mesopic with glare. The 
      Tecnis IOL provided significantly better contrast sensitivity at almost all 
      spatial frequencies in any lighting condition in comparison with the SN60AT IOL. 
      CONCLUSION: Implantation of a modified prolate IOL may improve quality of vision 
      as demonstrated by our clinical results of contrast sensitivity testing. In this 
      study, we found a better performance of the Tecnis IOL under both photopic and 
      mesopic conditions, compared to the results of the AR40e and the SN60AT IOL.

TI  - Supplementation with the carotenoids lutein or zeaxanthin improves human visual 
      performance.
PG  - 362-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Macular pigment (MP) is found in diurnal primate species when vision 
      spans a range of ambient illumination and is mediated by cone and rod 
      photoreceptors. The exact role of MP remains to be determined. In this study we 
      investigate two new hypotheses for possible MP functions. OBJECTIVE: As MP 
      absorption coincides partly with that of rhodopsin, MP may reduce rod signal 
      effectiveness in the mesopic range, thus extend the usefulness of cone-mediated 
      vision into the mesopic range. Forward light scatter in the eye can reduce 
      retinal image contrast. If blue light contributes significantly to intraocular 
      scatter, selective blue light absorption by MP could reduce the effects of 
      scatter. DESIGN: We investigated 34 subjects from a carotenoid supplementation 
      trial. The measurements included high mesopic contrast acuity thresholds (CATs), 
      macular pigment optical density (MPOD), wavefront aberrations, and scattered 
      light. The measurements were made after 6 months of daily supplementation with 
      zeaxanthin (Z, OPTISHARP), lutein (L), a combination of the two (C), or placebo 
      (P), and again after a further 6 months of doubled supplementation. RESULTS: The 
      data reveal a trend toward lower CATs in all groups supplemented, with a 
      statistically significant improvement in the lutein group (p = 0.001), although 
      there was no correlation with MPOD. Light scattering in the eye and the 
      root-mean-square wavefront aberrations show decreasing trends as a result of 
      supplementation, but no correlation with MPOD. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest 
      that supplementation with L or Z increases MPOD at the fovea and at 2.5 degrees , 
      and that supplementation can improve CATs at high mesopic levels and hence visual 
      performance at low illumination.

PG  - 28-30
AB  - We performed a prospective randomized study of 297 patients to determine the 
      effect of a UV-blocking filter on the operating microscope on the angiographic 
      incidence of cystoid macular edema in patients undergoing extracapsular surgery 
      with implantation of a posterior chamber lens. Patients were randomly allocated 
      preoperatively to two groups undergoing surgery with or without a UV filter in 
      place. Of the 297 patients, 205 had angiograms readable for the presence or 
      absence of cystoid macular edema. The incidence of aphakic cystoid macular edema 
      in patients without the filter was 21% v 17.3% in the group with a filter. This 
      difference was not significant. The presence of a UV-blocking filter on the 
      operating microscope makes no difference in the angiographic incidence of cystoid 
      macular edema or the visual outcome in these cases.

TI  - The economic impact of blue-light filtering intraocular lenses on age-related 
      macular degeneration associated with cataract surgery: a third-party payer's 
      perspective.
PG  - 1311-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Epidemiological data support an association between age-related 
      macular degeneration (AMD) and cataract surgery that may be attributed to 
      post-operative blue light exposure. By limiting the retina's blue light exposure, 
      new blue-light filtering intraocular lenses (BLF IOLs) have the potential to 
      reduce the development of AMD following cataract surgery. In the current economic 
      healthcare environment, there is increased interest in the cost impact of new 
      medical technologies. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the cost 
      impact of a BLF IOL versus a non-BLF IOL in cataract surgery. METHODS: An 
      economic model was developed to emulate three age-specific cohorts and to assess 
      the clinical and economic outcomes over 5 years. Data from the published 
      literature was supplemented with clinical expert opinion. Key literature inputs 
      involved the risk of AMD after cataract surgery as well as laboratory and animal 
      data on the effectiveness of the BLF IOL in reducing the risk of AMD. Clinical 
      experts provided information on the management of AMD. Direct medical costs 
      including the cost of the IOL, monitoring, and AMD prophylaxis and treatment were 
      incorporated into the model. All costs were standardized to 2004 US dollars. 
      Age-stratified sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: In the BLF IOL 
      group, the 5-year age-stratified incidence of AMD ranged from 0.58 to 9.23 per 
      100 eyes, compared with 1.69 to 24.55 per 100 eyes in the non-BLF IOL group. The 
      incremental cost of the BLF was offset by reduced costs associated with averted 
      AMD treatment. Estimated savings with BLF IOLs per 100 eyes were $4275, $29 997, 
      and $111 734 in the 55 to 64 year-old, 65 to 74 year-old, and >or= 75-year-old 
      cohorts, respectively; these findings remained robust throughout the sensitivity 
      analyses. CONCLUSION: Limitations of this analysis include the lack of 
      prospective clinical trial data that definitively demonstrate the efficacy of a 
      BLF IOL in preventing AMD. Moreover, the efficacy data used to populate the model 
      were derived from laboratory and animal studies. Thus, based on preliminary data, 
      this study suggests that the economic benefits of implanting BLF IOLs during 
      cataract surgery are observed in all patients over a 5-year timeframe although 
      cost savings are greatest in patients >or= 75 years.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare optical and visual quality of eyes implanted 
      with spherical and aspheric intraocular lenses (IOLs). METHODS: Twenty eyes of 17 
      patients were implanted with the AcrySof Natural IQ aspheric IOL (SN60WF) and 20 
      eyes of 15 patients were implanted with the AcrySof Natural spherical IOL 
      (SN60AT). Photopic monocular distance best spectacle-corrected visual acuity 
      (BSCVA) was recorded at 6 months postoperatively. Corneal aberrations were 
      measured with the CSO Eyetop topographer, and ocular aberrations were measured 
      with a Hartmann-Shack aberrometer for a 6-mm pupil. Ocular spherical aberration 
      was computed for different pupil diameters (3, 4, 5, and 6 mm). RESULTS: No 
      statistically significant differences were found between the BSCVA of the AcrySof 
      IQ IOL (0.023 +/- 0.004 logMAR) and AcrySof Natural IOL (0.031 +/- 0.003 logMAR) 
      (P = .15). The corneal higher order aberrations showed no statistically 
      significant differences between groups (P > .1). However, spherical aberration 
      and higher order ocular aberrations in the AcrySof IQ eyes were lower than eyes 
      implanted with the AcrySof Natural IOL (P < .01). A statistically significant 
      increase in the spherical aberration coefficient with pupil diameter was found 
      only for the spherical IOL group (P = .0023). Statistically significant 
      differences in the spherical aberration coefficient were found between groups at 
      all pupil diameters (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: A significant reduction in ocular 
      spherical aberration was noted after AcrySof IQ IOL implantation at all pupil 
      diameters compared to the spherical IOL, although photopic BSCVA between groups 
      remained similar.

      using the Mesotest II (Oculus GmbH). Blue-green color vision was evaluated with 
      the Moreland equation of the HMC Anomaloskop MR (Oculus GmbH). RESULTS: The mean 
      age of patients was 66.6 years +/- 8.2 (SD) in the Natural IOL group and 66.4 +/- 
      8.0 years in the conventional IOL group. There was no statistically significant 
      difference in photopic contrast sensitivity, scotopic contrast sensitivity with 
      and without glare, or disability glare between the 2 groups (P>.05). Photopic and 
      scotopic contrast sensitivity with and without glare significantly decreased with 
      age in both groups (P<.01). There was no statistically significant difference in 
      anomaloscope scores between the 2 groups (P>.05). The Moreland middle match point 
      showed a significant shift toward blue with age in both groups (P<.01). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The AcrySof SN60AT Natural IOL provided contrast sensitivity under 
      photopic and scotopic conditions (with and without glare) and blue color 
      perception comparable that obtained with the AcrySof SA60AT IOL. Scotopic vision 
      and blue color discrimination decreased with age with both IOLs.

AB  - PURPOSE: We examined changes in macular pigment optical density (MPOD) levels 
      after cataract surgery and compared the MPOD between eyes with clear intraocular 
      lenses (IOLs) and yellow-tinted IOLs. DESIGN: Prospective, comparative case 
      series. PARTICIPANTS: The MPOD levels were measured in 480 eyes of 337 patients 
      after cataract surgery. Among them, the data from 259 eyes (clear IOL group, 121 
      eyes; yellow-tinted IOL group, 138 eyes) of 259 Japanese patients were selected 
      for statistical analyses on the basis of the inclusion criteria: a postoperative 
      visual acuity (VA) of ≥0.8 and no fundus diseases. Only 1 eye of each patient was 
      enrolled. Patients provided informed consent to participate in this study on the 
      basis of the approval of the institutional review board before surgery. METHODS: 
      The patients selected the type of IOL to be implanted. The MPOD levels were 
      measured using resonance Raman spectroscopy on day 1 (baseline value); months 1, 
      3, and 6; and years 1 and 2 postoperatively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The 
      difference in MPOD levels between the IOL groups was analyzed by unpaired t 
      tests. The following parameters were analyzed by multiple regression analysis: 
      age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking history, glaucoma, diabetes, 
      preoperative VA, preoperative refractive error, and IOL power and type. RESULTS: 
      We found no significant differences in the baseline characteristics between the 2 
      groups. Until 6 months postoperatively, the MPOD levels did not differ 
      significantly between the groups. However, from 1 year onward, the levels were 
      significantly higher in the yellow-tinted IOL group compared with the clear IOL 
      group. By multiple regression analysis, 1 day postoperatively, older age and 
      diabetes were correlated with lower MPOD levels; 1 year postoperatively and 
      thereafter, however, lower MPOD levels were correlated with clear IOLs. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Cataract surgery with clear IOLs induced a greater decrease in 
      macular pigment levels compared with yellow-tinted IOLs during a longer follow-up 
      period. These findings agreed with observations that excessive light exposure is 
      associated inversely with MPOD, because clear IOLs transmit higher intensities of 
      blue light than yellow-tinted IOLs.

TI  - [Visual function with blue light filter IOLs].
PG  - 23-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, intraocular lenses (IOLs) with a blue light filter have 
      been introduced to protect the retina from age-related macular degeneration (AMD) 
      after cataract extraction. A reduction of longitudinal chromatic aberration by 
      filtering blue light may enhance patient's visual function. In this study we 
      compared subjective and objective parameters of visual function following 
      implantation of blue light filter (yellow) IOLs and IOLs of the same design 
      without filter. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 21 patients (21 eyes) underwent 
      implantation of an IOL with a blue light filter (AF-1 UY, Hoya, Japan), 22 
      patients (22 eyes) received an IOL without blue light filter (AF-1 UV, Hoya, 
      Japan). Patients were examined three months postoperatively for uncorrected and 
      best corrected spectacle visual acuity, mesopic and photopic contrast 
      sensitivity, colour vision and subjective quality of vision by a standard 
      questionnaire. RESULTS: Eyes with blue light filter IOLs did not show any 
      significant difference in any parameter analysed when compared to eyes without 
      the blue light filter IOL. Subjective quality of vision was considered to be high 
      by all patients and no significant difference was observed between the two IOL 
      groups. CONCLUSION: The visual function of patients with blue filter IOLs is not 
      significantly different to those without blue light filter IOLs. Since blue light 
      filter IOLs did not show any functional disadvantage, but potentially protect the 
      macula from AMD, blue light filter IOLs may be considered as a reasonable 
      alternative to traditional IOLs, especially in eyes with a high risk for the 
      development of macular degeneration.

TI  - Clinical results of the blue-light filtering AcrySof Natural foldable acrylic 
      intraocular lens.
PG  - 2319-23
AB  - PURPOSE: To verify the safety and effectiveness of the new AcrySof Natural (Alcon 
      Laboratories, Inc.) blue-light filtering intraocular lens (IOL), which was 
      designed to achieve a light-transmission spectrum similar to that of the natural 
      human crystalline lens. SETTING: Multicenter U.S. clinical trial. METHODS: In a 
      prospective randomized patient-masked multicenter study, 150 patients received 
      the AcrySof Natural IOL and 147 patients received the AcrySof single-piece IOL as 
      a control. Patients with bilateral age-related cataracts who were willing and 
      able to wait at least 30 days between cataract procedures and had verified normal 
      preoperative color vision were eligible for the study. Standardized surgery 
      included a 4.0 to 5.0 mm capsulorhexis and phacoemulsification. All lenses were 
      inserted in the capsular bag, with verification of in-the-bag placement of both 
      haptics. In all bilateral implantation cases, the same model IOL was used in each 
      eye. Postoperatively, contrast sensitivity and color perception were measured up 
      to 180 days and up to 1 year (for visual acuity) after implantation. RESULTS: No 
      statistically significant differences were discovered between the 2 patient 
      groups in visual acuity, contrast sensitivity evaluated under mesopic and 
      photopic conditions, or the number of patients who passed the Farnsworth D-15 
      color perception test. There were no lens-related adverse events in either group. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The blue-light filtering AcrySof Natural IOL was equivalent to the 
      conventional AcrySof lens in terms of postoperative visual performance. 
      Additional long-term clinical studies should show whether the IOL actually 
      provides the theoretical benefits to retinal health.

TI  - Blue light filtering intraocular lenses in phacoemulsification cataract surgery.
PG  - 57-60
AB  - Blue light can damage retina and cause age related macular degeneration. After 
      cataract surgery and lens removal retina stays unprotected. Blue light filtering 
      intraocular lenses (IOL) increase protection of the retina. In our prospective 
      study we investigated clinical results after bilateral implantation of Acrysof 
      Natural IOL to 30 patients (N = 60 eyes). In a control group (N = 60 eyes, 30 
      patients), standard acrysof IOL was implanted bilaterally. Uncorrected visual 
      acuity (UCVA), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and Nd YAG laser capsulotomy 
      rate were measured and compared with control group. Subjective patient's 
      satisfaction and subjective colour perception were also investigated. There was 
      no significant difference in UCVA, BCVA and Nd YAG laser capsulotomy rate between 
      the two groups. High patient's satisfaction was noticed (96.7% of patients would 
      implant Acrysof Natural IOL again). Acrysof Natural IOL enables good visual 
      acuity VA, low rate of Nd YAG laser capsulotomy and high patient's satisfaction 
      without colour perception disturbances.

TI  - Effect of an ultraviolet-filtering intraocular lens on cystoid macular edema.
PG  - 366-9
AB  - A prospective double-masked study of 301 patients was undertaken to compare the 
      effect of ultraviolet (UV) filtering in implant intraocular lenses (IOL) on the 
      angiographic incidence of cystoid macular edema (CME) in patients undergoing 
      extracapsular cataract extraction. Patients were randomized to receive either a 
      posterior chamber IOL that contained UV-absorbing chromophore or an identical IOL 
      which did not contain such a chromophore. All patients were scheduled for 
      fluorescein angiography between three and six months after surgery; 228 
      angiograms were obtained that were readable for the presence or absence of 
      angiographic CME. The mean interval following surgery was 4.3 months. The 
      incidence of CME was 18.8% (21 of 112) in patients who received lenses without 
      UV-filtering chromophore and 9.5% (11 of 116) in patients who received IOLs that 
      contained UV-filtering chromophore. These findings show that UV-filtering-IOLs 
      resulted in a statistically significant (P = 0.03) decrease in the incidence of 
      CME. The presence or absence of the UV-filtering chromophore did not, however, 
      significantly affect visual acuity in the early postoperative period.

LID - 115
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study evaluates patients with congenital aniridia and cataract 
      who underwent phacoemulsification, capsular tension ring placement, and foldable 
      intraocular lens implantation. METHODS: In this prospective case series, 10 
      patients (17 eyes) underwent cataract surgery via a 3.2 mm clear corneal 
      incision. A continuous circular capsulorhexis with <6 mm diameter was employed. A 
      capsular tension ring and HOYA yellow foldable posterior chamber intraocular lens 
      was implanted. All patients wore color contact lenses postoperatively. Paired t 
      test was used to compare visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and corneal 
      endothelial changes before and after surgery. RESULTS: A single surgeon performed 
      all surgeries. The best-corrected visual acuity improved from value 
      1.03 ± 0.27LogMAR preoperatively to value 0.78 ± 0.26LogMAR postoperatively 
      (p = 0.000). The photophobic symptoms improved significantly after surgery. The 
      mean corneal endothelial cell density before and after surgery was 3280 ± 473 
      cells/mm2 and 2669 ± 850 cells/mm2, respectively (p = 0.006). None of the 
      patients developed corneal endothelial decompensation or secondary glaucoma after 
      surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of congenital aniridia and coexistent cataract by 
      phacoemulsification, posterior chamber foldable lens implantation, capsular 
      tension ring placement was safe and effective. Use of colored contact lenses in 
      the postoperative period can reduce photophobic symptoms in this group of 
      patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ChiCTR-OOC-17011638 (retrospectively registered at 
      12,June,2017).

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are 2 main types of intraocular lens (IOL) currently implanted 
      in patients after cataract surgery. Till now, we do not know exactly what the 
      effect of intraocular lens implantation will be on the quality of sleep after 
      cataract surgery. METHODS: The binocular BF-IOL (BF-IOL Groups) and UVB-IOL 
      (UVB-IOL Groups) implantations were performed in 60 and 59 cataract patients, 
      respectively. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaires were 
      administered to evaluate the quality of sleep in patients preoperatively, 1 month 
      (1 m) and 12 months (12 m) postoperatively. Independent sample test and χ test 
      were used to evaluate the difference between the 2 groups; one-way ANOVA was used 
      to evaluate the difference preoperatively and postoperatively in each group. The 
      rank sum test was used for statistical analysis of 7 independent sleep components 
      in PSQI. RESULTS: As compared to preoperatively, the PSQI overall scores in both 
      groups improved significantly postoperatively (P = 0.00 at 1 m and 12 m). Among 
      the 7 components of PSQI, 2 of them (sleep latency and daytime dysfunction) 
      improved greatly postoperatively in both groups (P< 0.05). Although the 
      improvement of PSQI overall score in the UVB-IOL group was greater than that in 
      the BF-IOL Group only at early time (1 m) postoperatively (P = 0.00), but not 
      late time (12 m, P > 0.05) after the cataract surgery. CONCLUSION: The sleep 
      quality of cataract patients improved after IOL implantation, regardless of the 
      type of IOL, suggesting that BF-IOL might serve as an alternative to conventional 
      UVB-IOL without a detrimental effect on quality of sleep after cataract surgery.

TI  - Is cataract surgery a risk factor for progression of macular degeneration?
PG  - 9-12
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is a suggestion of increased risk or progression of 
      age-related macular degeneration after cataract surgery, which is related to the 
      increased exposure of the retina to short-wavelength light. RECENT FINDINGS: Cell 
      culture and animal work has described retinal and retinal pigment epithelium 
      phototoxicity on acute light exposure. Clinical studies suggest that the use of 
      short-wavelength-blocking intraocular lenses can help but may also affect visual 
      function and circadian rhythm. SUMMARY: Evidence to date fails to prove 
      conclusively that light alone or cataract surgery can induce or cause the 
      progression of age-related macular degeneration. A randomized clinical study of 
      the use of short-wavelength (blue)-blocking lenses to prove or disprove the 
      ability of these intraocular lenses to help in preventing progression of 
      age-related macular degeneration is needed.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess intraocular lens (IOL) shift along the visual axis induced by 
      ciliary muscle contraction with pilocarpine after cataract surgery and to compare 
      primary posterior continuous curvilinear capsulorrhexis (CCC) and posterior optic 
      buttonholing with IOLs implanted in the bag. SETTING: Department of 
      Ophthalmology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. DESIGN: Clinical 
      trial. METHODS: Eyes with age-related cataract had cataract surgery with 
      implantation of a nonaccommodating IOL (AF-1 YA-60BB). Surgery was performed with 
      primary posterior CCC and posterior buttonholing in 1 eye (study eyes) and with 
      conventional in-the-bag implantation in the contralateral eye (control eyes). 
      After a minimum of 6 months postoperatively, the anterior chamber depth was 
      assessed with partial coherence interferometry before and after application of 
      pilocarpine 2.0% and, after a washout interval of 1 week, before and after the 
      application of cyclopentolate 1.0%. RESULTS: Forty eyes of 20 patients were 
      enrolled. A slight backward shift of the IOL (+78 μm) in study eyes and in 
      control eyes (+118 μm) was detected after pilocarpine application (both P<.05). 
      No significant difference in IOL shift was found between study eyes and control 
      eyes (P=.19). CONCLUSIONS: Combined primary posterior CCC and posterior optic 
      buttonholing did not affect IOL shift during pharmacologically stimulated ciliary 
      muscle contraction compared with in-the-bag implanted IOLs. Capsule fibrosis 
      diminished with primary posterior CCC but did not seem to be the only limiting 
      factor in the accommodative IOL shift. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE: No author has a

TI  - Comparison of higher order aberrations with spherical and aspheric IOLs compared 
      to normal phakic eyes.
PG  - 728-32
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare higher order aberrations (HOA) in AcrySof SN60AT and Acrysof 
      IQ SN60WF intraocular lenses (IOLs) and natural crystalline lenses in an 
      age-matched population. METHODS: Sixty-nine eyes of 55 patients were examined. 
      Group I included AcrySof spheric lenses, group II AcrySof aspheric lenses, and 
      group III included patients with the natural crystalline lens. The HOA data were 
      obtained with a LADARWave aberrometer (Alcon Inc.). Analysis was based on the RMS 
      of coma, spherical aberrations (SA), and HOA. Statistical comparisons were 
      performed with Kruskal Wallis variance analysis. RESULTS: In the case of coma, 
      there were statistically significant differences between spheric and aspheric 
      AcrySof (p<0.005) and between spheric AcrySof and natural crystalline lenses 
      (p<0.005). The differences between aspheric AcrySof and natural crystalline lens 
      group were not significant (p>0.05). SA were significantly different between 
      spheric and aspheric AcrySof group, and spheric AcrySof and natural crystalline 
      lens group (p<0.005), as well as between aspheric AcrySof and natural crystalline 
      lens group (p<0.05). In case of HOAno significant differences were observed 
      between aspheric AcrySof and natural crystalline lens group (p>0.05), but 
      differences between groups AcrySof spheric and aspheric, and spheric AcrySof and 
      natural crystalline lens, showed high significance (p<0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      AcrySof Natural IQ aspheric model SN60WF IOL did not change the optical quality 
      of vision compared to a healthy population of 60-80 years of age. The AcrySof 
      Natural model SN60AT spherical IOL resulted in higher HOAs relative to both the 
      natural crystalline lens population and eyes after aspheric AcrySof IQ model 
      SN60WF IOL implantation.

TI  - [The effect of blue light on human retinal pigment epithelium cells α1D subunit 
      protein expression and vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast 
      growth factor secretion in vitro].
PG  - 814-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of blue light on human retinal pigment 
      epithelium (RPE) α1D subunit protein expression and its relationship with 
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor 
      (bFGF) secretion in vitro. METHODS: The fourth generation cultured human RPE 
      cells in vitro were randomly divided into 4 groups, group A (control), group B 
      (exposure to blue light), group C (exposure to blue light+nifedipine), group D 
      [exposure to blue light+(-)Bay K8644]. Cells were exposed to blue light (2 000 ± 
      500) lx for 6 hours, and cells culture completed 24 hours later. VEGF and bFGF 
      concentration were assayed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to analysis L-type calcium channel 
      α1D subunit mRNA expression. Western blot was used to examine the protein 
      expression of L-type calcium channel α1D subunit. Analysis of variance was used 
      to compare the difference of α1D subunit mRNA and protein expression, VEGF and 
      bFGF concentration between groups. Correlation analysis was used to show the 
      relationship between α1D subunit protein expression and concentration of VEGF and 
      bFGF. RESULTS: (1) There is significant statistically difference in the 
      population mean of VEGF and bFGF concentration in four groups (F = 99.441, 
      21.310, P = 0.000,0.000) . VEGF and bFGF concentration in group B (3 281.51 ± 
      251.73, 1 346.81 ± 62.27) and group D (3 808.01 ± 94.01, 1 485.82 ± 108.97) was 
      higher than it was in group A (2 401.09 ± 228.07, 1 232.42 ± 65.41) , which was 
      statistically different (P = 0.000, 0.000, 0.019, 0.000). And it was higher in 
      group D (3 808.01 ± 94.01, 1 485.82 ± 108.97) compared with group B (3 281.51 ± 
      251.73, 1 346.81 ± 62.27) (P = 0.000, 0.006). While, it was lower in group C (1 
      927.28 ± 143.11, 1 149.39 ± 62.99) than it was in group B (3 281.51 ± 251.73, 1 
      346.81 ± 62.27) (P = 0.000, 0.000) . (2) The mean of mRNA expression of α1D 
      subunit between four groups was statistically significant (F = 50.320, P = 0.000) 
      . It was higher in group B (210 ± 23) , group D (478 ± 80) and group C (232 ± 14) 
      than group A (100 ± 20). It was statistically significant different (P = 0.023, 
      0.006, 0.010). And it was higher in group D (478 ± 80) than group B (210 ± 23) 
      and C (232 ± 14) (P = 0.032, 0.039). (3) There was statistically significant 
      difference in the expression of L-type calcium channel α1D subunit protein in 
      four groups (F = 1 940.363, P = 0.000) . It was significantly higher (P = 
      0.000,0.000) in group B (0.974 2 ± 0.014 7) and group D (0.654 9 ± 0.005 0) than 
      group A (0.503 2 ± 0.007 5). And it was higher in group D (0.654 9 ± 0.005 0) 
      than it was in group C (0.413 9 ± 0.008 8) (P = 0.000). (4) There was positive 
      correlation between the L-type calcium channel α1D subunit protein expression and 
      VEGF concentration secreted by retinal pigment epithelium cells (r = 0.674, F = 
      8.333, P = 0.016), but there was no correlation with bFGF concentration (r = 
      0.537, F = 4.061, P = 0.072). CONCLUSIONS: L-type calcium channel α1D subunit may 
      be involved in blue light induced damage on human retinal pigment epithelial 
      cells. Blue light exposure can induce the mRNA and protein expression of α1D 
      subunit, VEGF and bFGF concentration in retinal pigment epithelium cells 
      Increased. And there was a positive correlation between α1D subunit protein 
      expression and the VEGF concentration.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare wavefront aberration, depth of focus, contrast sensitivity, 
      and in vivo modulation transfer function (MTF) after fellow-eye implantation of 
      aspheric and spherical intraocular lenses (IOLs). SETTINGS: Department of 
      Ophthalmology, St. Thomas' Hospital, London, United Kingdom. METHODS: This 
      prospective randomized controlled study comprised patients with bilateral 
      cataract who received an aspheric AcrySof SN60WF IOL or a spherical AcrySof 
      SN60AT IOL in the first eye and the other IOL in the second eye. Assessments at 3 
      and 6 months included 100% and 9% logMAR best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and 
      photopic and mesopic functional acuity contrast testing. Total internal and 
      corneal aberrations and depth of focus were computed. Distance-corrected near 
      logMAR acuity was available at 12 months. RESULTS: At 3 and 6 months, there was 
      no significant difference in 100% and 9% BCVA or photopic contrast sensitivity. 
      Mesopic contrast sensitivity was better and total and internal spherical 
      aberrations were significantly less with the aspheric IOL. Total and internal eye 
      vertical coma was reduced with aspheric IOL. Total MTF was not significantly 
      different between groups. The aspheric IOL group had 0.46 diopter less depth of 
      focus than the spherical IOL group at 6 months (P<.05). Distance-corrected near 
      acuity was significantly better with the spherical IOL. CONCLUSIONS: Aspheric 
      IOLs significantly reduced spherical aberration, improving mesopic contrast 
      sensitivity. Vertical coma was reduced with aspheric IOLs. Reduction of 
      aberrations may be responsible for reduced depth of focus with aspheric IOLs. 
      This may be disadvantageous for near vision and reading ability.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the potential effect of surface light scattering on light 
      transmittance of 1-piece hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lenses (IOLs) with or 
      without a blue-light filter. SETTING: John A. Moran Eye Center, University of 
      Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. DESIGN: Experimental study. METHODS: Intraocular 
      lenses were obtained from human cadavers (49 IOLs total; 36 with blue-light 
      filter) and from finished-goods inventory (controls). The IOLs were removed from 
      cadaver eyes and the power and model matched to unused controls. After surface 
      proteins were removed, the IOLs were hydrated for 24 hours at room temperature. 
      Surface light scattering was measured with a Scheimpflug camera (EAS-1000 
      Anterior Segment Analysis System). Light transmittance was measured with a Lambda 
      35 UV/Vis spectrophotometer (single-beam configuration; RSA-PE-20 integrating 
      sphere). RESULTS: Hydrated scatter values ranged from 4.8 to 202.5 
      computer-compatible tape (CCT) units for explanted IOLs with blue-light filter 
      and 1.5 to 11.8 CCT units for controls; values ranged from 6.0 to 137.5 CCT units 
      for explanted IOLs without a blue-light filter and 3.5 to 9.6 CCT units for 
      controls. In both groups, there was a tendency toward increasing scatter values 
      with increasing postoperative time. No differences in light transmittance were 
      observed between explanted IOLs and controls in both groups (IOLs with blue-light 
      filter: P=.407; IOL with no blue-light filter: P=.487; both paired t test). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Although surface light scattering of explanted IOLs was 
      significantly higher than that of controls and appeared to increase with time, no 
      effect was observed on light transmittance of 1-piece hydrophobic acrylic IOLs 
      with or without a blue-light filter.

      following cataract surgery.
PG  - 1656-9
LID - 10.1136/bjophthalmol-2011-300677 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Since 2002 the discovery of a novel population of intrinsically 
      photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, expressing the photopigment melanopsin, 
      has attracted broad interest in human blue-light mediated non-visual effects 
      including circadian regulation and cognitive function. Ageing is associated with 
      insomnia and cognitive decline. It has been postulated that reduced blue-light 
      transmission through the formation of cataract impairs melanopsin dependant 
      non-visual brain responses mediated by intrinsically photosensitive retinal 
      ganglion cells. We aimed to establish if any objective improvement in cognition 
      could be demonstrated using a reaction time task (RTT) following cataract surgery 
      and intraocular lens implantation. METHODS: Following strict inclusion and 
      exclusion criteria, 15 patients (age range 59-87, mean 75.4 years) with bilateral 
      cataract performed the RTT before and after surgery on one eye. The mean and the 
      SD of two modalities of reaction time, namely complex reaction time and simple 
      reaction time, were measured and analysed. RESULTS: Responses became both quicker 
      and more consistent following surgery, with statistically significant 
      improvements in the complex reaction time (p=0.016) and the complex reaction time 
      SD (p=0.055), which were not due to a learning effect or improved vision. 
      CONCLUSION: The results suggest that improved blue-light transmission following 
      cataract surgery has a beneficial effect on cognitive function. We advocate the 
      RTT as an objective platform for exploring these benefits in large sample 
      randomised controlled trials.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare visual acuity and contrast sensitivity (CS) in eyes implanted 
      with aspheric and spherical intraocular lenses (IOLs) after cataract surgery. 
      DESIGN: Randomized, prospective study. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred twenty-four 
      eyes from 262 cataract surgery patients implanted with 2 IOL models: the AcrySof 
      IQ (262 eyes) and AcrySof SN60AT (262 eyes; Alcon Laboratories, Fort Worth, TX). 
      METHODS: High-contrast photopic best-corrected distance visual acuity (BCVA) and 
      CS under photopic (85 cd/m(2)) and mesopic (6 cd/m(2)) conditions were measured. 
      Pupil diameter was analyzed for distance vision under both lighting conditions. 
      Follow-up was carried out for 6 months in all patients. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: 
      Best-corrected distance visual acuity and photopic and mesopic CS after 
      implantation under monocular and binocular conditions. RESULTS: No statistically 
      significant differences in BCVA were found between either IOL (0.06+/-0.06 and 
      0.05+/-0.07 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution units for AcrySof SN60AT 
      and AcrySof IQ groups, respectively; P = 0.091). One hundred percent of patients 
      achieved BCVA of 20/32 or better in both groups. The percentage of patients who 
      achieved BCVA of 20/25 or better was 86.3%. The AcrySof IQ IOL group showed 
      better monocular and binocular CS at 6, 12, and 18 cpd under photopic conditions 
      and at 3, 6, 12, and 18 cpd under mesopic conditions (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Eyes 
      implanted with the aspheric AcrySof IQ IOL showed better photopic and mesopic CS 
      at medium and high spatial frequencies than eyes implanted with the spherical 
      AcrySof SN60AT IOL. High-contrast photopic BCVA was similar between both IOLs.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate photopic and mesopic color discrimination in patients with 
      different types of light-filtering intraocular lenses (IOLs). SETTING: Peking 
      University Third Hospital, Peking University Eye Center, Beijing, China. METHODS: 
      Cataract patients with different types of IOLs were enrolled 3 months 
      postoperatively. Overall and partial color discrimination under photopic (1000 
      lux) and mesopic (40 lux) conditions were evaluated with the Farnsworth-Munsell 
      (FM) 100-hue test. Corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) was tested under both 
      conditions. Subjective visual quality was assessed with the 25-item National Eye 
      Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25). RESULTS: The study 
      evaluated 43 patients with a blue light-filtering IOL (15 photochromic, 13 yellow 
      tinted) or an IOL filtering ultraviolet light only (n = 15). The difference in 
      the FM 100-hue total error scores under photopic or mesopic conditions was not 
      statistically significant between groups. There were no statistically significant 
      differences in partial error scores in the 10 bands of the FM 100-hue color 
      circle under photopic conditions. Under mesopic condition, there were 
      statistically significant differences in partial error scores in the green to 
      blue-green band (color caps 36 to 46) and the blue-green to blue band (color caps 
      46 to 54) (P = .005 and P = .030, respectively). There were no statistically 
      significant differences in mean overall or subheading NEI VFQ-25 scores. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Filtering blue lights under mesopic conditions seemed to modify 
      color discrimination in the green-to-blue bands postoperatively. The modification 
      did not disturb overall color discrimination or cause subjective discomfort.

LID - 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.04.052 [doi]
AB  - Functionalised siloxane macromonomers, with properties designed for application 
      as an injectable, in situ curable accommodating intraocular lens (A-IOL), were 
      prepared via re-equilibration of a phenyl group-containing polysiloxane of very 
      high molecular weight with octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D₄) and 
      2,4,6,8-tetra(n-propyl-3-methacrylate)-2,4,6,8-tetramethyl-cyclotetrasiloxane 
      (D₄(AM)) in toluene using trifluoromethanesulfonic acid as a catalyst. 
      Hexaethyldisiloxane was used as an end group to control the molecular weight of 
      the polymer. The generated polymers had a consistency suitable for injection into 
      the empty lens capsule. The polymers contained a low ratio of polymerisable 
      groups so that, in the presence of a photo-initiator, they could be cured on 
      demand in situ within 5 min under irradiation of blue light to form an 
      intraocular lens within the lens capsule. All resulting polysiloxane soft gels 
      had a low elastic modulus and thus should be able to restore accommodation. The 
      pre-cure viscosity and post-cure modulus of the generated polysiloxanes were 
      controlled by the end group and D₄(AM) concentrations respectively in the 
      re-equilibration reactions. The refractive index could be precisely controlled by 
      adjusting the aromatic ratio in the polymer to suit such application as an 
      artificial lens. Lens stretching experiments with both human and non-human 
      primate cadaver lenses of different ages refilled with polysiloxane polymers 
      provided a significant increase in amplitude of accommodation (up to 4 D more 
      than that of the respective natural lens). Both in vitro cytotoxicity study using 
      L929 cell lines and in vivo biocompatibility study in rabbit models demonstrated 
      the non-cytotoxicity and ocular biocompatibility of the polymer.

TI  - Comparison of visual function following implantation of Acrysof Natural 
      intraocular lenses with conventional intraocular lenses.
PG  - 152-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently an intraocular lens (IOL) has been introduced which blocks 
      blue light. As blocking blue light may be to the patient's detriment, this study 
      was designed to evaluate visual function following implantation of a 
      blue-blocking (Acrysof Natural) IOL. METHODS: Patients were recruited for this 
      non-randomized controlled interventional study, from those attending a private 
      rural ophthalmology clinic for cataract surgery (n = 93). Only those who had 
      previously had a conventional IOL implanted into one eye were offered an Acrysof 
      Natural IOL for the second eye. Postoperatively patients underwent refracted 
      Snellen visual acuity, contrast sensitivity using a CSV-1000E instrument and 
      colour vision testing using a Farnsworth D-15 test, with a subset (n = 20) 
      undergoing a Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue test. Results were then compared between 
      eyes. Finally, a subset (n = 63) completed a survey designed to assess the 
      subjective impact of the Acrysof Natural IOL. RESULTS: There were no 
      statistically significant differences between eyes implanted with conventional 
      IOLs compared with Acrysof Natural IOLs for visual acuity (t = 0.57; P = 0.57), 
      contrast sensitivity (t = 0.43; P = 0.67 for 3 cycles per degree [cpd], t = 0.56; 
      P = 0.58 for 6 cpd, t = 0.09; P = 0.93 for 12 cpd and t = 0.16; P = 0.87 for 18 
      cpd) or colour vision with the Farnsworth D-15 (Chi(2) = 0.38; P = 0.55) or the 
      Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue test t = 0.34; P = 0.74). Most subjects reported that 
      they could not tell a difference between the two IOLs subjectively or that any 
      difference experienced was not significant. CONCLUSION: Our sample did not show 
      any significant differences between eyes implanted with conventional IOLs and the 
      Acrysof Natural IOL. We would suggest that the Acrysof Natural IOL may be used 
      without any significant difference in visual function.

TI  - Ocular exposure to solar ultraviolet and visible radiation at high latitudes.
PG  - 398-403
AB  - Exposure of the eyes to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and short wavelength light, 
      blue light, from the sun was assessed under realistic geometric conditions. A 
      spectroradiometer with a double monochromator was used to determine the spectral 
      irradiance at 1-nm intervals within the wavelength range of 250-800 nm. 
      Biological weighting functions were used to calculate the blue-light radiance and 
      the weighted UV irradiance. In addition, a photometer with a 1 degree angle of 
      view was used to measure the ambient luminance. The results indicate that sizable 
      amounts of UV radiation and blue light can be reflected from different 
      environmental surroundings. Hence various groups of outdoor workers seem to be at 
      risk of chronic ocular overexposure to solar radiation. When occupational 
      exposure limits for UV and visible radiation are revised, the risks of chronic 
      exposure should receive more consideration than to date.

TI  - Clinical study of Acrysof IQ aspheric intraocular lenses.
PG  - 358-62
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether implantation of anaspheric intraocular lens (SN 60 
      WF Alcon) results in reduced spherical aberration and improved contrast 
      sensitivity after cataract surgery. METHODS: Randomized, prospective study. 260 
      patients/eyes were randomized to receive two intraocular lens types: Alcon 
      Acrysof Natural (136 eyes) and Acrysof IQ (124 eyes). Quality of vision was 
      measured by visual acuity and contrast sensitivity under mesopic and photopic 
      conditions. Ocular aberrations for 4.0- and 6.0-mm pupil were measured with 
      Allegretto Wavelight Analyzer. All ophthalmologic were performed 7, 30 and 90 
      days postoperatively. Visual function index (VF-14) questionnaires for cataract 
      symptoms were performed 90 days after surgery by all the patients. RESULTS: After 
      90 days, all eyes had mean postoperative best spectacle-corrected visual acuity 
      0.75. Eyes with the Acrysof IQ had significantly higher contrast sensitivity than 
      eyes with the Acrysof Natural at high and middle spatial frequencies. A 
      significant reduction in spherical aberration after Acrysof IQ implantation was 
      achieved. The Acrysof IQ also had lower values of high-order aberration with 4.0- 
      and 6.0-mm pupil when compared with the AcrySof Natural. CONCLUSION: Results show 
      the aspheric Acrysof IQ induced significantly less high-order aberration and 
      spherical aberration compared with the Acrysof Natural. Contrast sensitivity 
      revealed better values with the Acrysof IQ intraocular lens.

TI  - Objective assessment of inflammation after cataract surgery: comparison of 3 
      similar intraocular lens models.
PG  - 677-81
LID - 10.1016/j.jcrs.2008.12.021 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare postoperative inflammation in patients receiving 1 of 3 
      AcrySof intraocular lenses (IOLs): MA60AC (Group 1), SA60AT (Group 2), or SN60AT 
      (Group 3). SETTING: Service d'Ophtalmologie, Université Paris Descartes Hôpital 
      Cochin, Paris, France. METHODS: This prospective randomized 3-month study 
      included eyes that received 1 of the 3 IOL models with standard surgery and 
      postoperative care. Anterior chamber cells were assessed at the slitlamp and 
      anterior chamber flare values, with a Kowa 500 flare meter. RESULTS: Fifty-nine 
      patients (59 eyes) with a mean age of 72.7 years were evaluated. Group 1 and 
      Group 2 comprised 20 eyes each and Group 3, 19 eyes. No eye had anterior chamber 
      cells at baseline. In all 3 groups, the presence of anterior chamber cells was 
      highest 1 week postoperatively and generally decreased at subsequent visits, with 
      no statistically significant differences between IOL groups at 1 week (P = 
      .2655), 1 month (P = .073), or 3 months (P = .5766). A similar proportion of eyes 
      in each IOL group had residual cells in the anterior chamber at 3 months; the 
      cells were not clinically significant. In all groups, the mean flare values were 
      low (<11 photons/ms) at baseline (P = .4522) and statistically similar between 
      groups at each subsequent visit (P>or=.2801). There were no adverse events. 
      CONCLUSION: The 3 IOLs models, including the blue light-filtering model, had 
      similar anterior chamber cells and flare values over a 3-month period, showing 
      the lack of difference in inflammation induced by cataract surgery with 
      implantation of the 3 similar IOL models.

TI  - Relative effectiveness of a blue light-filtering intraocular lens for 
      photoentrainment of the circadian rhythm.
PG  - 529-39
LID - 10.1016/j.jcrs.2008.11.040 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the relative effectiveness of photoentrainment of the 
      circadian rhythm by a blue light-filtering tinted intraocular lens (IOL) (AcrySof 
      Natural SN60), an untinted UV-only filtering IOL (AcrySof SA60), and human lenses 
      in 4 age groups. SETTING: Scientific consultant and Department of Biological 
      Structure and National Primate Research Center, University of Washington, 
      Seattle, Washington, USA. METHODS: Three of 8 action spectra for circadian 
      photoentrainment published from 2001 to 2007 were used to compute the relative 
      effectiveness of the cumulative photon flux absorption from 400 to 600 nm 
      reaching the retina from 4 light sources through the cornea, pupil, and 6 lenses. 
      RESULTS: The effectiveness of the tinted IOL was 35% to 54% and 69% to 114% 
      greater with the action spectra of 2002 to 2007, with a peak around 484 nm and 
      492 nm, respectively, compared with the 2001 action spectra, with a peak around 
      460 nm. The difference in effectiveness between the 2 IOLs ranged from 32% to 
      12%. With newer action spectra, differences in effectiveness between the tinted 
      IOL and the lenses of a young standard observer and a 30- to 39-year-old were age 
      dependent (+7% to -10% and +6% to -13%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The tinted 
      IOL was significantly more effective for photoentrainment of the circadian rhythm 
      with newer action spectra. The computational results suggest that the 
      effectiveness of the tinted IOL in 60- to 85-year-old patients would be within 
      +6% to -13% of that in 30 to 39 year olds. Both tinted and untinted IOLs are 
      expected to be effective for melatonin suppression under average household 
      illumination.

TI  - Clinical evaluation of the use of infracyanine green staining for internal 
      limiting membrane peeling in epimacular membrane surgery.
PG  - 972-9
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the use of infracyanine green (IFCG) staining in idiopathic 
      epiretinal membrane (ERM) surgery. METHODS: A retrospective comparative study of 
      63 consecutive eyes with ERM operated on with internal limiting membrane (ILM) 
      peeling using or not filtered IFCG diluted (5:1) in glucose 5%. Main outcome 
      measures were best-corrected visual acuity, central visual field perimetry, 
      fluorescein angiography with blue light fundus photograph, optical coherence 
      tomography (OCT), and in seven eyes multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG). 
      RESULTS: A total of 44 eyes underwent surgery with ILM staining using IFCG and 19 
      eyes without. In the IFCG group, the staining showed that the ILM was removed 
      together with the ERM in 39% of eyes; ILM was still present on the macula after 
      ERM removal in 57% of eyes and removed secondarily. The improvement in vision was 
      slightly better in the IFCG group throughout follow-up but the difference was not 
      significant. On the postoperative blue light photograph, defects in the optic 
      nerve fibre layer were less frequent in the group with IFCG than without 
      (p=0.023), suggesting less peroperative trauma. Two eyes in the group operated 
      without IFCG had recurrence of the ERM including one with a macular hole vs none 
      in the group with IFCG. No difference was observed in the groups as regards 
      central visual field testing, mfERG, OCT, or angiographic data. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Using IFCG for ILM peeling in ERM surgery seemed to reduce significantly the 
      trauma to the optic nerve fiber layer and to prevent ERM recurrence. Deleterious 
      effects were not observed in this study.

LID - S0004-27492012000500004 [pii]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the possible effect of aspherical or yellow tinted 
      intraocular lens (IOL) on contrast sensitivity and blue-on-yellow perimetry. 
      METHODS: This prospective randomized bilateral double-masked clinical study 
      included 52 patients with visually significant bilateral cataracts divided in two 
      groups; 25 patients (50 eyes) received aspherical intraocular lens in one eye and 
      spherical intraocular lens in the fellow eye; and 27 patients (54 eyes) received 
      ultraviolet and blue light filter (yellow tinted) IOL implantation in one eye and 
      acrylic ultraviolet filter IOL in the fellow eye. The primary outcome measures 
      were contrast sensitivity and blue-on-yellow perimetry values (mean deviation 
      [MD] and pattern standard deviation [PSD]) investigated two years after surgery. 
      The results were compared intra-individually. RESULTS: There was a statistically 
      significant between-group (aspherical and spherical intraocular lens) difference 
      in contrast sensitivity under photopic conditions at 12 cycles per degree and 
      under mesopic conditions at all spatial frequencies. There were no between-group 
      significant differences (yellow tinted and clear intraocular lens) under photopic 
      or mesopic conditions. There was no statistically significant difference between 
      all intraocular lens in MD or PSD. CONCLUSION: Contrast sensitivity was better 
      under mesopic conditions with aspherical intraocular lens. Blue-on-yellow 
      perimetry did not appear to be affected by aspherical or yellow tinted 
      intraocular lens. Further studies with a larger sample should be carried out to 
      confirm or not that hypotheses.

TI  - Fine matrix mapping of the macular region in normal subjects.
PG  - 243-9
AB  - Using a Humphrey field analyzer and fine matrix mapping, we measured photopic and 
      scotopic thresholds for a blue light stimulus at 100 locations on a 9 degrees by 
      9 degrees matrix of 1 degree spacing centered at the fovea in 14 normal subjects. 
      Additionally, trial lenses were used to investigate the effect of refractive 
      error. Under photopic conditions the mean sensitivity varied by less than 1 dB 
      over this region. Under scotopic conditions the central values were reduced in 
      sensitivity by 15 dB compared with those at 4 degrees eccentricity. Defocus 
      showed less than 1.2 dB loss with 1.00D of refractive error under photopic 
      condition. The results reflect the properties of rod and cone photoreceptors and 
      the effects of the rod mosaic near the fovea. This technique is a sensitive test 
      of macular visual function.

      aspheric intraocular lenses.
PG  - 1234-8
LID - 10.1016/j.jcrs.2009.03.013 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine and compare the incidence of posterior capsule 
      opacification (PCO) and neodymium:YAG (Nd:YAG) laser capsulotomy after 
      implantation of 3 intraocular lens types (IOLs). SETTING: Storm Eye Institute, 
      Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, USA. METHODS: 
      This retrospective chart review comprised eyes having uneventful 
      phacoemulsification and implantation of 1 of 3 AcrySof IOLs: ReSTOR SN60D3 
      (multifocal spherical group), Natural SN60AT (monofocal spherical group), or IQ 
      SN60WF (monofocal aspheric group). Eyes were matched by age, sex, and follow-up. 
      The PCO rate, Nd:YAG capsulotomy rate, time from surgery to PCO diagnosis, and 
      time from surgery to Nd:YAG capsulotomy were assessed. RESULTS: Charts of 225 
      eyes (75 in each group) with a mean follow-up of 15.9 months +/- 6.5 (SD) were 
      evaluated. The PCO rate was 42.7% in the multifocal spherical group, 28.0% in the 
      monofocal spherical group, and 14.7% in the monofocal aspheric group. The Nd:YAG 
      capsulotomy rate was 25.3%, 17.3%, and 4.0%, respectively. The difference in the 
      Nd:YAG rate was statistically significantly higher in the multifocal and 
      monofocal spherical groups than in the monofocal aspheric group (P<.001 and 
      P<.008, respectively) but was not significantly different between the 2 spherical 
      IOL groups (P = .232). The time from surgery to PCO documentation was not 
      significantly different between the 3 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Intraocular lens 
      configuration may have contributed to the difference in the PCO rate between the 
      2 spherical IOLs and the aspheric IOL. Based on the Nd:YAG rate as an indicator 
      for visual significance, PCO may be less visually significant in eyes with the 
      aspheric IOL than in eyes with 1 of the spherical IOLs.

TI  - Color perception with AcrySof natural and AcrySof single-piece intraocular lenses 
      under photopic and mesopic conditions.
PG  - 236-42
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine color perception in patients receiving bilateral implantation 
      of an ultraviolet (UV) and blue-light filtering intraocular lens (IOL) (AcrySof 
      Natural SN60AT, Alcon Laboratories Inc.) or a UV-only filtering IOL (AcrySof 
      SA60AT) and to compare the results with those in a phakic group. SETTING: 
      Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. METHODS: In this prospective study, age-matched subjects 
      who passed the Ishihara test and had visual acuities of 20/25 or better were 
      recruited. There were 2 pseudophakic groups (bilateral SN60AT or SA60AT IOLs) and 
      1 phakic group. The Farnsworth-Munsell (FM) 100-hue test was administered to each 
      subject twice under different conditions. The phakic and AcrySof Natural SN60AT 
      groups were tested under photopic and mesopic conditions. The SA60AT subjects 
      were further divided into subgroups (with and without yellow clip-on lenses) and 
      tested under photopic and mesopic conditions. RESULTS: A 1-way analysis of 
      variance (ANOVA) of the square-root-transformed total error score showed no 
      statistical differences (P = .637) between the treatment groups. Similarly, a 
      1-way ANOVA of the red-green error score (P = .729) and blue-yellow error score 
      (P = .484) indicated no statistically significant differences between the 
      treatment groups. The ANOVA results of the FM 100-hue test under mesopic 
      conditions showed that the total error score in the AcrySof Natural IOL group was 
      significantly lower (P = .046) than in the phakic group. There were no 
      between-group differences in error scores under mesopic conditions. CONCLUSION: 
      The FM 100-hue testing showed no difference in color perception between subjects 
      with AcrySof Natural IOLs and those in an age-matched phakic control group or in 
      those with a UV-only filtering AcrySof IOL with or without yellow clip-on lenses.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of the AF-1 (UY) blue-light-filtering intraocular 
      lens (IOL) with a yellow chromophore (Hoya) on visual function, including 
      contrast vision and color perception. SETTINGS: Five clinical ophthalmology 
      centers in Germany. METHODS: Two types of IOLs that were identical except for a 
      blue-light filter on 1 were compared in a prospective randomized multicenter 
      study with intraindividual comparisons. Postoperatively, uncorrected and best 
      corrected visual acuities, pupil size, contrast vision (Early Treatment Diabetic 
      Retinopathy Study chart, functional acuity contrast test, photopic, mesopic, 
      mesopic with glare), and color discrimination (Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test, 
      photopic and mesopic) were evaluated. RESULTS: There were no significant 
      differences between the 2 IOLs except in color vision dependent on blue light. 
      Color perception for blue with the blue-light-filtering IOL was significantly 
      reduced under mesopic conditions over the 12-month follow-up and under photopic 
      conditions over 6 months. Despite the difference, all measured total error scores 
      were within normal range and no patient reported impaired color vision. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The blue-light-filtering IOL with a yellow chromophore had no effect 
      on contrast vision and visual acuity. However, the impairment of color perception 
      for blue was statistically significant. The impairment of the blue perception did 
      not exceed the normal range or induce subjective disturbance of color vision.

TI  - Determination of valid benchmarks for outcome indicators in cataract surgery: a 
      multicenter, prospective cohort trial.
PG  - 2105-12
LID - 10.1016/j.ophtha.2011.05.011 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a systematic approach to derive valid benchmarks for 2 
      outcome indicators intended to ascertain quality in cataract surgery and to 
      propose benchmark levels drawn from the study results. DESIGN: Prospective, 
      multicenter cohort trial. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1685 patients (206-239 eyes 
      per trial site) were recruited consecutively at 7 study sites. The patients 
      featured age-related cataracts and were undergoing unilateral cataract surgery in 
      the period between January 2007 and August 2008. METHODS: Only patients with 
      uncomplicated age-related cataracts were included. Cataract surgery was performed 
      by phacoemulsification. The SN60AT (Alcon, Inc., Fort Worth, TX) intraocular lens 
      (IOL) was used as a study lens. The IOL power was calculated using the SRK-T 
      formula with a standardized A constant. Biometry was performed with the IOL 
      Master (Carl Zeiss Meditex, Jena, Germany). Only highly experienced senior 
      surgeons were involved. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome indicators 1 month and 
      3 months after surgery were the respective achievement of: (1) maximum absolute 
      deviation of 0.5 diopter (D) between target refraction and postoperative 
      spherical equivalent (primary end point, refractive accuracy); (2) best-corrected 
      visual acuity of at least 0.8 (secondary end point, visual acuity outcome). 
      RESULTS: In the pooled data, maximum absolute deviation of ± 0.5 D from target 
      refraction was achieved in 80% (95% confidence interval, 78%-82%) of cases. 
      Visual acuity of 0.8 or more was reached in 87% (95% confidence interval, 
      80%-93%) of cases. The results from the trial centers differed significantly in 
      the outcomes of the primary and secondary end points (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      study quantified benchmark levels for 2 outcome indicators in a standardized 
      cataract surgery procedure. External confounding factors such as the comorbidity 
      of patients, which cannot be influenced by the surgeon, were excluded. The 
      derived benchmarks selectively illustrate the quality of the surgery and are 
      superior to success rates published in the literature from unspecific data 
      collections. This method is more suited for improving outcome quality by 
      benchmarking. General methodologic problems are discussed, leading to 
      recommendations for future study designs. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): The author(s)

TI  - Functional and perceived benefits of wearing coloured filters by patients with 
      age-related macular degeneration.
PG  - 450-4
LID - 10.1111/cxo.12031 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim was to investigate the visual effect of coloured filters 
      compared to transmission-matched neutral density filters, in patients with dry 
      age-related macular degeneration. METHODS: Visual acuity (VA, logMAR), contrast 
      sensitivity (Pelli-Robson) and colour vision (D15) were recorded for 39 patients 
      (average age 79.1 ± 7.2 years) with age-related macular degeneration, both in the 
      presence and absence of glare from a fluorescent source. Patients then chose 
      their preferred coloured and matched neutral density transmission filters (NoIR). 
      Visual function tests were repeated with the chosen filters, both in the presence 
      and absence of glare from the fluorescent source. Patients trialled the two 
      filters for two weeks each, in random order. Following the trial of each filter, 
      a telephone questionnaire was completed. RESULTS: VA and contrast sensitivity 
      were unaffected by the coloured filters but reduced through the neutral density 
      filters (p < 0.01). VA and contrast sensitivity were reduced by similar amounts, 
      following the introduction of the glare source, both in the presence and absence 
      of filters (p < 0.001). Colour vision error scores were increased following the 
      introduction of a neutral density filter (from 177.6 ± 60.2 to 251.9 ± 115.2) and 
      still further through coloured filters (275.1 ± 50.8; p < 0.001). In the absence 
      of any filter, colour vision error scores increased by 29.1 ± 55.60 units in the 
      presence of glare (F2,107 = 3.9, p = 0.02); however, there was little change in 
      colour vision error scores, in the presence of glare, with either the neutral 
      density or coloured filters. Questionnaires indicated that patients tended to 
      gain more benefit from the coloured filters. CONCLUSIONS: Coloured filters had 
      minimal impact on VA and contrast sensitivity in patients with age-related 
      macular degeneration; however, they caused a small reduction in objective colour 
      vision, although this was not registered subjectively by patients. Patients 
      indicated that they received more benefit from the coloured filters compared with 
      neutral density filters.

TI  - [Effect of cut off filters on contrast perception in retinitis pigmentosa].
PG  - 829-32
AB  - Cut-off filter glasses can protect retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients from 
      dangerous short-wave light and UV radiation. Subjective improvements in contrast 
      sensitivity and glare sensitivity are additional beneficial effects of such 
      glasses. Because of the relatively high costs the prescription of cut-off filters 
      is limited. To establish an objective criterion for prescription we performed 
      psychophysical tests of contrast sensitivity in 12 RP patients with and without 
      cut-off filters. We used a computerized test (Neuroscientific, New York, NY) in 
      which six spatially different static sinusoidal grid patterns were presented on a 
      high-resolution monitor (Joyce). Contrast-transfer functions were derived by a 
      two-alternative forced choice method. Only 2 of the 12 tested patients--all of 
      whom reported subjective beneficial effects of the cut-off filters on contrast 
      sensitivity--showed significant improvement in the test. In 5 patients we found 
      non-significant improvement while 5 showed nearly no change. Patients with low 
      contrast sensitivity showed a relatively high benefit from the filters, 
      especially with low spatial frequencies. However, in the majority of RP patients 
      the method used here cannot provide objective criteria for the prescription of 
      cut-off filters.

TI  - Medical management of a high bleb phase after trabeculectomies.
PG  - 1169-73
AB  - In the first 2 months after trabeculectomy, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) 
      associated with a high bleb develops in some patients. This has been referred to 
      as an encysted bleb, and some have recommended surgical techniques to repair it 
      and to restore controlled IOP. This clinical picture occurred in 18 of 181 eyes 
      (10%) undergoing simple trabeculectomy with a limbus-based conjunctival flap and 
      tenonectomy. It did not occur among 69 eyes in which trabeculectomy with a 
      fornix-based flap was combined with extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE). Its 
      occurrence may, therefore, be related to surgical technique. In eyes with this 
      syndrome, the authors used IOP-lowering eyedrops and/or pills, along with 
      continued corticosteroid eyedrops. None required surgical manipulation. All 18 
      eyes achieved long-term IOP control, and in 14 all medications were ultimately 
      discontinued. An hypothesis is suggested to explain the occurrence of this event 
      and the rationale for this therapy. A trial of IOP-lowering treatment is 
      indicated in the management of a high bleb phase after filtering surgery.

      implantation with aspheric intraocular lens].
PG  - 43-7
AB  - PURPOSE: To initially evaluate the early visual function after implantation with 
      aspheric intraocular lens METHODS: Eighty-eight subjects (91 eyes) were divided 
      randomly into three groups: AcrySof IQ (SN60WF) group, KS-3Ai group and AcrySof 
      Natural (SN60AT) group. Best corrected visual acuity was observed 1 day, 1 week 
      and 1 month postoperatively, while contrast sensitivity and subjective vision 
      were observed 1 month later. RESULTS: Best corrected visual acuity was obviously 
      better in KS-3Ai group than in the other groups 1 day postoperatively (P < 0.05), 
      but no significant difference was found 1 week and 1 month later among the groups 
      (P > 0.05). When the pupil diameter was in 2.5 to 4.0 mm and 5.0 to 6.0 mm, 
      AcrySof IQ and KS-3Ai groups were better than the AcrySof Natural group in the 
      low and middle spatial frequency (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant 
      difference between AcrySof IQ and KS-3Ai groups (P > 0.05). VF/QOL questionnaire 
      was obtained, showing that implantation with AcrySof IQ and KS-3Ai satisfied 
      patients preferably. CONCLUSIONS: Aspheric intraocular lens can greatly improve 
      patients' contrast sensitivity and quality of vision.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of AcrySof SN60WF aspheric intraocular lens 
      (IOL) in decreasing spherical aberration and total higher order aberrations 
      (HOAs) after cataract surgery compared to the spherical SN60AT lens. METHODS: 
      Wavefront analysis was conducted on 28 eyes of 28 patients that underwent 
      un-complicated phacoemulsification with implantation of either SN60WF (15 eyes) 
      or SN60AT lenses (13 eyes). Eyes with a history of uveitis, retinal diseases, and 
      previous surgery were excluded. RESULTS: SN60WF eyes had less mean absolute 
      spherical aberration than SN60AT eyes both at 4 mm (0.04+/-0.03 vs 0.11+/-0.03 
      RMS, p<0.0001) and 6 mm pupils (0.09+/-0.04 vs 0.43+/-0.12 RMS, p<0.0001). Mean 
      total HOAs was lower in the SN60WF group at 6 mm pupils (0.44+/-0.14 vs 
      0.56+/-0.13 RMS, p=0.0274), while no difference was seen at 4 mm pupils 
      (0.20+/-0.10 vs 0.25+/-0.08 RMS, p=0.160). There were no clinically significant 
      differences between the SN60WF and SN60AT IOLs both at 4 and 6 mm pupils in terms 
      of coma (0.16+/-0.07 vs 0.18+/-0.09 RMS, p=0.514 and 0.25+/-0.12 vs 0.23+/-0.12 
      RMS, p=0.664) and trefoil (0.14+/-0.09 vs 0.10+/-0.05 RMS, p=0.167 and 
      0.28+/-0.12 vs 0.23+/-0.07 RMS, p=0.199). There were no differences be-tween 
      groups in mean age, axial length, postoperative spherical equivalent, IOL power, 
      or corneal curvature. CONCLUSIONS: An aspheric posterior optic IOL design with 
      thinner center effectively reduces the positive ocular spherical aberration 
      observed in the pseudophakic and elderly eyes, especially at larger pupillary 
      diameters (6 mm), with no notable increase in coma. However, reduction in total 
      ocular HOAs was only significant at 6 mm pupils.

AB  - There is currently considerably interest in the vulnerability of the pseudophakic 
      eye ultraviolet light. Contrast sensitivity was measured in patients receiving 
      UV-absorbing and standard posterior chamber intraocular lenses (IOLs) and in 
      normal age-matched observers. The results suggest that in the relative short-term 
      there is no difference in visual performance with either type of IOL. Modulation 
      Transfer Function studies on 3 batches of IOLs (2 standard and 1 UV-absorbing) 
      showed slight variations in optical performance within and between batches. 
      Spectral sensitivity testing demonstrated increased macular protection from short 
      wave-length blue light by the crystalline lens when compared with both types of 
      IOL.

TI  - Augmentation of macular pigment following implantation of blue light-filtering 
      intraocular lenses at the time of cataract surgery.
PG  - 4777-85
LID - 10.1167/iovs.08-3277 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: (Photo)-oxidative stress is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis 
      of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), with the threshold for retinal damage 
      being lowest for short-wavelength (blue) light. Macular pigment (MP), consisting 
      of the carotenoids lutein (L), zeaxanthin (Z) and meso-Z, has a maximum 
      absorption at 460 nm and protects the retina from (photo)-oxidative injury. This 
      study was designed to investigate whether the blue light-filtering properties of 
      the Alcon AcrySof Natural intraocular lens (ANIOL) implanted during cataract 
      surgery affects MP optical density (MPOD). METHODS: Forty-two patients scheduled 
      for cataract surgery were recruited for the study. These patients all had a 
      preoperative best corrected visual acuity rating (BCVAR) of at least 0.5 (logMAR) 
      in the study eye. The patients were randomized to have either the standard Alcon 
      AcrySof three-piece acrylic intraocular lens (AIOL) (controls) or the ANIOL 
      implanted at the time of cataract surgery. The spatial profile of MPOD (i.e., at 
      0.25 degrees, 0.5 degrees, 1.0 degrees, and 1.75 degrees eccentricity) was 
      measured with customized heterochromatic flicker photometry (cHFP) 1 week before 
      and 1 week after surgery, and at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. Serum 
      concentrations of L and Z were also measured at each study visit. RESULTS: There 
      was a highly significant and positive correlation between all MPODs (e.g., at 
      0.25 degrees) recorded 1 week before and after surgery in eyes with an AIOL 
      implant (r = 0.915, P < 0.01; paired samples t-test, P = 0.631) and in those 
      ANIOL implants (r = 0.868, P < 0.01; paired samples t-test, P = 0.719). Average 
      MPOD across the retina increased significantly with time (after 3 months) in the 
      ANIOL group (repeated-measures, general linear model, P < 0.05), but remained 
      stable in the AIOL group (repeated-measures, general linear model, P > 0.05). 
      There were no significant time or lens effects observed for serum L over the 
      study period (P > 0.05). There was a significant time effect for serum Z over the 
      study period (P < 0.05), but not a significant time/lens interaction (P > 0.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Customized HFP can reliably measure the MPOD spatial profile in the 
      presence of lens opacity, and cataract surgery does not artifactually alter MPOD 
      readings. This study also provides evidence that implanting an IOL that filters 
      blue light is associated with augmentation of MPOD in the absence of raised serum 
      concentrations of L and Z. However, further and longitudinal study is needed to 
      assess whether the observed increase in MPOD after implantation of blue-filtering 
      IOLs is associated with reduced risk of AMD development and/or progression.

TI  - Collimator with filtration compensator: clinical adaptation to meet European 
      Union recommendation 4F on radiological protection for dental radiography.
PG  - 413-20
LID - 10.1259/dmfr/15580890 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to develop a compensated filtration collimator for use in 
      paediatric patients undergoing cephalometric radiography that reduces the 
      radiation dose administered and fulfils recommendation 4F of the European 
      guidelines on radiation protection in dental radiology. METHODS: An easy to use 
      filtration-compensated collimator was constructed of plastic, lead and aluminium 
      and used randomly with a group of 32 children (mean age 11 years) undergoing 
      cephalometric radiography before receiving orthodontic treatment. The radiation 
      doses administered to patients (eye lens and thyroid, submandibular and parotid 
      glands) and to the chassis of the radiographic equipment were determined. 
      RESULTS: The filtration-compensated collimator is easily fixed to the external 
      surface of the radiographic equipment and results in (a) as collimator, a 
      reduction of 40% in the surface irradiated in the children and of 61.4% in the 
      dose administered to the thyroid glands (P<0.001); (b) as filtration compensator, 
      a reduction of 32.8% administered to the eye lens (P<0.001), 31.45% to the 
      submaxillary gland (P<0.01) and 11.4% to the parotid gland (P<0.05); there was no 
      difference in the dose determined on the radiographic film. CONCLUSIONS: A 
      radiographic examination can be carried out with children using only a third of 
      the dose normally used with no increase in the time or cost involved.

AB  - We examined the effect of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) on the 
      activity of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) using 
      the pupil as proxy. Eighteen patients with AION (10 unilateral, 8 bilateral) and 
      29 age-matched control subjects underwent chromatic pupillometry. Red and blue 
      light stimuli increasing in 0.5 log steps were presented to each eye 
      independently under conditions of dark and light adaptation. The recorded pupil 
      contraction was plotted against stimulus intensity to generate scotopic and 
      photopic response curves for assessment of synaptically-mediated ipRGC activity. 
      Bright blue light stimuli presented monocularly and binocularly were used for 
      melanopsin activation. The post-stimulus pupil size (PSPS) at the 6th second 
      following stimulus offset was the marker of intrinsic ipRGC activity. Finally, 
      questionnaires were administered to assess the influence of ipRGCs on sleep. The 
      pupil response and PSPS to all monocularly-presented light stimuli were impaired 
      in AION eyes, indicating ipRGC dysfunction. To binocular light stimulation, the 
      PSPS of AION patients was similar to that of controls. There was no difference in 
      the sleep habits of the two groups. Thus after ischemic injury to one or both 
      optic nerves, the summated intrinsic ipRGC activity is preserved when both eyes 
      receive adequate light exposure.

LID - 10.2147/OPTH.S21819 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the correlation between 
      contrast sensitivity and calculated higher-order aberrations based on individual 
      natural pupil diameter after cataract surgery. METHODS: This prospective study 
      included 120 eyes from 92 patients who were randomized to receive one of four 
      lenses, including three aspheric lenses (Acrysof SN60WF, Tecnis ZA9000, and Hoya 
      Py60AD) and one spherical lens (Acrysof SN60AT). Contrast sensitivity, 
      higher-order aberrations of the whole eye, and pupil diameter under photopic and 
      mesopic conditions were measured 1 month postoperatively. Higher-order 
      aberrations were decomposed into Zernike coefficients, calculated according to 
      individual pupil diameter. The correlation between higher-order aberrations and 
      contrast sensitivity was evaluated. RESULTS: There were no significant 
      differences in contrast sensitivity function between the four types of lenses 
      under photopic conditions. However, the contrast sensitivity function and area 
      under log contrast sensitivity function in the aspheric lenses were significantly 
      better than in the spherical lens under mesopic conditions. Under mesopic 
      conditions, spherical aberration in eyes with aspheric lenses was significantly 
      lower than in eyes with spherical lenses (P < 0.05). Under photopic conditions, 
      coma aberration had a significant negative correlation with contrast sensitivity 
      at 12 cycles/degree. Under mesopic conditions, spherical aberration had a 
      significant negative correlation with contrast sensitivity at 3, 6, and 12 
      cycles/degree with glare, and with contrast sensitivity at 6 and 18 cycles/degree 
      without glare. CONCLUSION: In terms of influence on visual function, coma 
      aberration may be more significant under photopic conditions and spherical 
      aberration under mesopic conditions.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate potential differences in the quality of vision after 
      implantation of a blue light-filtering intraocular lens (IOL) and an ultraviolet 
      (UV) light-filtering IOL. SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Ruhr-University, 
      Bochum, Germany. DESIGN: Prospective randomized cohort study. METHODS: Patients 
      with age-related cataract had bilateral standardized small-incision Kelman 
      phacoemulsification-based cataract surgery with implantation of a blue 
      light-filtering IOL (Oculaid PC 440Y Orange Series) in 1 eye and a UV 
      light-filtering IOL (Oculaid PC 430 Elite Series) in the other eye. Outcome 
      measures included scotopic and photopic corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) 
      and photopic uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), color discrimination, and 
      contrast sensitivity with and without glare. A questionnaire was used to assess 
      patient satisfaction. Postoperative follow-up visits were scheduled at 1, 3, and 
      6 months. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (44 eyes) completed the study. There were 
      no statistically significant differences in UDVA, CDVA, or contrast sensitivity 
      with or without glare between the 2 IOL groups. Color discrimination was 
      significantly decreased in eyes with blue light-filtering IOLs compared with UV 
      light-filtering IOLs, except along the red-green axis (P=.118). No subjective 
      differences in color or light perception were found. CONCLUSIONS: Both IOL types 
      provided similar postoperative visual function except color perception, which was 
      slightly better in eyes with a clear IOL. Although differences were not 
      clinically significant, information about potential disturbances in color vision 
      might be provided before implanting an orange blue light-filtering IOL. FINANCIAL

PG  - 397-400
AB  - To evaluate protection of vitamin C on blue light-induced DNA damage of human 
      retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. The cultured RPE cells were divided into 
      3 groups: Control group (no blue light exposure), blue light exposure group (blue 
      light exposure for 20 minutes) and blue light exposure + vitamin C group (blue 
      light exposure + 100 mumol/L vitamin C). Travigen's comet assay kit and Euclid 
      comet assay software were used to assay the DNA damage levels. The DNA percentage 
      in the tail of electrophoretogram in the three groups were 18.44%, 54.42% and 
      32.43% respectively (p < 0.01). Tail moments were 8.2, 48.3, and 18.4 
      respectively (p < 0.01). Blue light could induce DNA damage to RPE cells but 
      vitamin C could protect the RPE cells from the blue light-induced DNA damage.

TI  - Effects of lutein and zeaxanthin on aspects of eye health.
PG  - 2-12
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.3785 [doi]
AB  - Lutein and zeaxanthin are members of the oxygenated carotenoids found 
      particularly in egg yolks and dark-green leafy vegetables. A great deal of 
      research has focused on their beneficial roles in eye health. The present article 
      summarises the current literature related to the bioactivity of these 
      carotenoids, emphasising their effects and possible mechanisms of action in 
      relation to human eye health. Available evidence demonstrates that lutein and 
      zeaxanthin are widely distributed in a number of body tissues and are uniquely 
      concentrated in the retina and lens, indicating that each has a possible specific 
      function in these two vital ocular tissues. Most of epidemiological studies and 
      clinical trials support the notion that lutein and zeaxanthin have a potential 
      role in the prevention and treatment of certain eye diseases such as age-related 
      macular degeneration, cataract and retinitis pigmentosa. The biological 
      mechanisms for the protective effects of these carotenoids may include powerful 
      blue-light filtering activities and antioxidant properties. Although most studies 
      point towards significant health benefits from lutein and zeaxanthin, further 
      large-scale randomised supplementation trials are needed to define their effects 
      on ocular function in health and disease.

TI  - Increased prevalence of disciform macular degeneration after cataract extraction 
      with implantation of an intraocular lens.
PG  - 441-5
AB  - After cataract extraction with implantation of an intraocular lens the increased 
      transmission of ultraviolet and blue light may accelerate the development of 
      age-related macular degeneration by producing free radicals in the retina. The 
      maculae of 82 randomly selected postmortem human pseudophakic eyes and 16 fellow 
      phakic eyes were examined by light microscopy. The presence of a basal laminar 
      deposit, hard and soft drusen, thickening and calcification of Bruch's membrane, 
      geographic atrophy, subretinal neovascularisation, and disciform scars was 
      assessed in a standardised way. An age-matched series of 126 postmortem phakic 
      eyes was used as control group. There was no difference between the two groups, 
      except for a higher prevalence of hard drusen (exact trend test, p = 0.038) and 
      disciform scars for the pseudophakic eyes (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.007). There 
      was no significant correlation between either age-related changes in the macula 
      or disciform degeneration and the length of time between cataract surgery and 
      death. No significant difference was found between pseudophakic eyes with or 
      without ultraviolet filter. These findings do not confirm that disciform scar 
      formation is caused by an increase in ultraviolet or blue light.

TI  - Effect of tinted optical filters on visual acuity and contrast sensitivity in 
      patients with inflammatory cystoid macular edema.
PG  - 483-9
AB  - PURPOSE: To ascertain the effect of tinted optical filters (TFs) on visual 
      function in patients with inflammatory cystoid macular edema (CME). METHODS: A 
      prospective study included 14 patients with inflammatory CME and best-corrected 
      visual acuity between 0.1 and 0.8 (CME group) and 16 sex-, age-, and 
      best-corrected visual acuity-matched patients with macular disorders but no CME 
      (non-CME group). All patients from both groups underwent the following tests: 
      determination of visual acuity at distance, contrast sensitivity (CS) testing; 
      and subjective grading of each TF for best-corrected visual acuity and CS 
      compared with no TFs. All tests were performed with the following TFs: Corning 
      photochromic filter with a cutoff at 450 nm; Zeiss filter with a cutoff at 560 
      nm; and cheap widely available yellow filter with a cutoff at 489 nm. RESULTS: 
      Without TFs, the CME and non-CME groups did not differ in best-corrected visual 
      acuity (P = 0.79). Using the TFs, a clinically significant improvement was not 
      achieved by any patient. However, using the definition of any improvement, 
      best-corrected visual acuity with all TFs showed a significant improvement in the 
      CME group compared with no TFs (P < 0.01). The CME group rated the Corning 
      photochromic filter with a cutoff of 450 nm significantly higher than the other 
      TFs when determining visual acuity (P = 0.05) and CS (P = 0.01) in contrast to no 
      improvement in the non-CME group. CONCLUSION: Although the use of TFs for the CME 
      patients was not associated with criteria of clinically significant improvement, 
      our results indicate that visual acuity and CS in patients with inflammatory CME 
      might benefit from the use of TFs.

TI  - Do blue-light filtering intraocular lenses affect visual function?
PG  - 1348-54
LID - 10.1097/OPX.0000000000000390 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To study different aspects of visual function, macular changes, and 
      subjective differences between the eye with an ultraviolet (UV) and blue-light 
      filtering intraocular lens (IOL) and the fellow eye with a UV-light filtering 
      IOL. METHODS: Thirty patients (60 eyes) with senile cataract had both cataracts 
      extracted, and an IOL was implanted at least 2 years before clinical evaluation. 
      In one eye, AcrySof SA60AT (a UV-light filtering IOL) was implanted, whereas in 
      the contralateral eye, AcrySof IQ SN60WF (a blue-light filtering IOL) was 
      implanted. Each patient underwent visual acuity testing, color vision testing 
      (Ishihara and Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue tests), and contrast sensitivity (CS) 
      testing. The macula was evaluated with optical coherence tomography and with 
      clinical examination. Patients were asked if they noted any difference between 
      the implanted IOLs concerning visual impression. Subjective visual quality was 
      evaluated using the National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire. 
      RESULTS: There was a borderline statistically significant difference in the mean 
      best-corrected visual acuity (p = 0.05). As regards color vision, no significant 
      changes in Ishihara and Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue error scores were detected 
      between both eyes (p = 0.48 and p = 0.59, respectively). Analysis of CS showed no 
      significant difference between the groups at any spatial frequency. There were 
      also no statistically significant differences in central macular thickness and 
      total macular volume between the two IOL groups (p = 0.72 and p = 0.61, 
      respectively). In both IOL groups, three eyes developed an epiretinal membrane, 
      and six eyes developed early signs of age-related macular degeneration. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study showed no significant effects of a blue-light filtering 
      IOL on visual acuity and no influence on color perception and CS. After more than 
      2 years, there were no significant differences in macular changes between the IOL 
      groups. Clinical evidence of the effect of a blue-light filtering IOL on macular 
      protection is still lacking.

AB  - Blue-sensitive cone thresholds (the ability to detect blue test lights presented 
      on a bright yellow background) were measured to examine foveal and central vision 
      field sensitivity in groups of 33 glaucoma, 31 ocular hypertension (OHT) and 24 
      age matched normal subjects. Results showed these thresholds were substantially 
      reduced (in all areas tested) for the glaucoma group (approximately 0.8 log 
      units) and less reduced for the OHT group (approximately 0.2 log units), when 
      compared to the normal group threshold. Measures of red-sensitive and 
      green-sensitive cone thresholds showed no difference for all three groups. 
      Furthermore, 16% of the OHT group showed visual field abnormalities for the 
      blue-sensitive cone threshold measure. We conclude that efforts to detect early 
      function loss in glaucoma and OHT could be improved using these measures in 
      clinical practice.

AB  - Photoswitches are traditional pharmacologic agonists, antagonists, or channel 
      blockers that are covalently modified with an azobenzene derivative. Azobenzene 
      undergoes wavelength-dependent isomerization between cis and trans conformation. 
      For some photoswitches, only one of these configurations is biologically active, 
      resulting in light-dependent activation or inhibition of function. Photoswitches 
      that feature a quaternary ammonium coupled to the azobenzene moiety cause 
      light-dependent neuronal depolarization due to blockage of voltage-gated 
      potassium channels. Two photoswitch strategies have been pursued. In the 
      one-component strategy, the photoswitch is applied to native receptors; in the 
      two-component strategy, the photoswitch is combined with virally-mediated 
      expression of a genetically modified receptor, to which the photoswitch may 
      covalently bind. The former approach is simpler but the latter allows precise 
      anatomic targeting of photoswitch activity. Acrylamide-azobenzene-quaternary 
      ammonium (AAQ) is the prototypical first-generation one-component photoswitch. 
      When applied to retinas with outer retinal degeneration, ganglion cell firing 
      occurs in response to blue light, and is abrogated by green light. In vivo, AAQ 
      restored pupillary light responses and behavioral light responses in blind 
      animals. DENAQ is a prototypical second generation one-component photoswitch. It 
      features spontaneous thermal relaxation so cell firing ceases in dark, and 
      features a red-shifted activation spectrum. Interestingly, DENAQ only 
      photoswitches in retinas with outer retinal degeneration. MAG is a photoswitched 
      glutamate analog which covalently binds to a modified ionotropic glutamate 
      receptor, LiGluR. When applied together, MAG and LiGluR also rescue physiologic 
      and behavioral light responses in blind mice. Together, photoswitch compounds 
      offer a potentially useful approach to restoration of vision in outer retinal 
      degeneration.

PG  - 2115-9
LID - 10.1016/j.jcrs.2011.06.024 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the possible side effects and potential protection 5 years 
      after implantation of an intraocular lens (IOL) with a blue-light filter (yellow 
      tinted). SETTING: Ophthalmology Department, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, 
      Brazil. DESIGN: Prospective randomized clinical study. METHODS: Patients with 
      bilateral visually significant cataract randomly received an ultraviolet (UV) and 
      blue light-filtering IOL (Acrysof Natural SN60AT) in 1 eye and an acrylic UV 
      light-filtering only IOL (Acrysof SA60AT) in the fellow eye. The primary outcome 
      measures were contrast sensitivity, color vision, and macular findings 5 years 
      after surgery. RESULTS: The study enrolled 60 eyes of 30 patients. There were no 
      significant clinical or optical coherence tomography findings in terms of 
      age-related macular degeneration in any eye. There were no statistically 
      significant differences in central macular thickness between the 2 IOL groups 
      (P=.712). There were also no significant between-group differences under photopic 
      or scotopic conditions at any spatial frequency studied. No statistically 
      significant differences in the color discrimination test were found between the 2 
      IOL groups (P=.674). CONCLUSIONS: After 5 years, there were no significant 
      differences in color perception, scotopic contrast sensitivity, or photopic 
      contrast sensitivity between the blue light-filtering (yellow-tinted) IOL and the 
      IOL with a UV-light filter only (untinted). The potential advantage of the tinted 
      IOL in providing protection to macular cells remains unclear.

TI  - [Lutein and antioxidants in the prevention of age-related macular degeneration].
PG  - 37-8, 40-5
AB  - Demographic developments in Europe and North America are causing an increase of 
      age-related diseases. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the 
      leading causes of severe central visual acuity loss in elderly people and seems 
      to be an economic problem, too. There is evidence that oxidative damage is an 
      important factor for exacerbation of AMD. Macular pigment with its antioxidative 
      effect may serve as"natural sunglasses" filtering the blue light acting as a 
      possible source of photooxidative damage to the neurosensory retina. The macular 
      pigment consists mostly of lutein and zeaxanthin. These micronutrients from the 
      group of carotenoids, as is the case for vitamins (vitamins C, E, and 
      beta-carotene), cannot be synthesized in mammals and that is the reason why the 
      role of micronutrition or its supplementation and its correlation to AMD 
      progression has been discussed for years. The results of currently published 
      studies are often contradictory. At present there are no results from randomized 
      controlled studies confirming that supplementation of lutein and zeaxanthin can 
      reduce the risk for AMD. Several epidemiological studies investigating the impact 
      of antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids on the incidence of AMD provided 
      conflicting results.Up to now, AREDS is the largest randomized controlled study 
      investigating the effect of supplementation of antioxidants, zinc, and copper on 
      the progression of AMD. AREDS showed a significant effect of this supplementation 
      in some particular groups of patients with AMD. The supplementation of lutein and 
      omega-3 fatty acids is not toxic but a positive effect has not been proven by 
      randomized studies.

PG  - 327-332
LID - 10.1136/bjophthalmol-2015-307820 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: To assess the efficacy and safety of dexamethasone (DEX) 
      intravitreal implant in patients with active serpiginous choroiditis (SC) already 
      receiving maximal tolerated systemic immunosuppressive therapy. METHODS: In this 
      retrospective longitudinal study we evaluated patients receiving 0.7 mg DEX 
      intravitreal implant for active SC despite maximal systemic immunosuppression. 
      Medical history was reviewed over a period of 18 months for each patient. We 
      diagnosed SC activity using direct fundus examination and blue-light fundus 
      autofluorescence. Primary outcomes were the rate of disease control and 
      functional changes at end of follow-up. Secondary outcomes were the incidence of 
      injection-related adverse events and the success of immunosuppression tapering at 
      the last examination. RESULTS: We examined eight eyes of seven patients. We 
      controlled SC activity with one injection in five eyes, two injections in one 
      eye, and three injections in two eyes (total of 13 implants). Best-corrected 
      visual acuity at the end of the investigational period improved in two eyes 
      (25%), remained stable in four eyes (50%) and decreased in two eyes (25%). Three 
      eyes showed transient intraocular pressure increase and two eyes disclosed 
      cataract progression. The average dosage of systemic prednisone at baseline and 
      after DEX intravitreal implant decreased from 8.8 to 2.8 mg/day. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Dexamethasone intravitreal implant may be an effective treatment option to 
      control active serpiginous lesions in patients in whom increased systemic 
      corticosteroid therapy is contraindicated.

      lenses (IOLs) by different manufacturers. SETTING: Ludwig Boltzmann Institute of 
      Retinology and Biomicroscopic Laser-Surgery, Department of Ophthalmology, Rudolf 
      Foundation Clinic, Vienna, Austria. DESIGN: Comparative case series. METHODS: 
      Eyes were randomized to 1 of the following IOLs: AF-1 (UY) (yellow tinted), 
      AcrySof SN60AT (yellow tinted), AF-1 (UV) (clear), or AcrySof SA60AT (clear). One 
      week and 2 months postoperatively, monocular contrast sensitivity function and 
      color discrimination were tested and the corrected distance and near visual 
      acuities were evaluated. All tests were performed under different light 
      intensities (10 to 1000 lux). RESULTS: Of the 80 patients enrolled, 76 completed 
      the study; there were 37 eyes in the yellow-tinted IOL group and 39 in the clear 
      IOL group. There were no significant differences between yellow-tinted IOLs and 
      clear IOLs except in color vision under mesopic conditions (10 lux). Patients 
      with a yellow-tinted IOL made significantly more mistakes in the blue-light 
      spectrum than patients with clear IOLs (P = .00015). There was no significant 
      difference under photopic conditions (1000 lux). CONCLUSIONS: The yellow-tinted 
      IOLs were equivalent to the clear IOLs in postoperative contrast sensitivity, 
      visual acuity, and color perception under photopic conditions. Patients with 
      yellow-tinted IOLs made statistically significantly more mistakes in the blue 
      range under dim light than patients with clear IOLs.

TI  - Blue and Red Light-Evoked Pupil Responses in Photophobic Subjects with TBI.
PG  - 108-117
LID - 10.1097/OPX.0000000000000934 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Photophobia is a common symptom in individuals suffering from traumatic 
      brain injury (TBI). Recent evidence has implicated blue light-sensitive 
      intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) in contributing to 
      the neural circuitry mediating photophobia in migraine sufferers. The goal of 
      this work is to test the hypothesis that ipRGC function is altered in TBI 
      patients with photophobia by assessing pupillary responses to blue and red light. 
      METHODS: Twenty-four case participants (mean age 43.3; 58% female), with mild TBI 
      and self-reported photophobia, and 12 control participants (mean age 42.6; 58% 
      female) were in this study. After 10 minutes of dark adaptation, blue (470 nm, 1 
      × 10 phots/s/cm) and red (625 nm, 7 × 10 phots/s/cm) flashing (0.1 Hz) light 
      stimuli were delivered for 30 seconds to the dilated left eye while the right 
      pupil was recorded. The amplitude of normalized pupil fluctuation (constriction 
      and dilation) was quantified using Fourier fast transforms. RESULTS: In both case 
      and control participants, the amplitude of pupil fluctuation was significantly 
      less for the blue light stimuli as compared to the red light stimuli, consistent 
      with a contribution of ipRGCs to these pupil responses. There was no significant 
      difference in the mean pupil fluctuation amplitudes between the two participant 
      groups, but case participants displayed greater variability in their pupil 
      responses to the blue stimulus. CONCLUSIONS: Case and control participants showed 
      robust ipRGC-mediated components in their pupil responses to blue light. The 
      results did not support the hypothesis that ipRGCs are "hypersensitive" to light 
      in TBI participants with photophobia. However, greater pupil response variability 
      in the case subjects suggests that ipRGC function may be more heterogeneous in 
      this group.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A number of published randomized controlled trials have been 
      conducted to evaluate visual performance of blue light-filtering intraocular 
      lenses (IOL) and UV light-filtering intraocular lenses (IOL) after cataract 
      phacoemulsification surgery. However, results have not always been consistent. 
      Therefore, we carried out a meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness of blue 
      light-filtering IOLs versus UV light-filtering IOLs in cataract surgery. METHODS 
      AND FINDINGS: Comprehensive searches of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and the 
      Chinese BioMedical literature databases were performed using web-based search 
      engines. Fifteen trials (1690 eyes) were included for systematic review, and 11 
      of 15 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that there 
      were no significant differences in postoperative mean best corrected visual 
      acuity, contrast sensitivity, overall color vision, or in the blue light spectrum 
      under photopic light conditions between blue light-filtering IOLs and UV 
      light-filtering IOLs [WMD = -0.01, 95%CI (-0.03, 0.01), P = 0.46; WMD = 0.07, 
      95%CI (-0.04, 0.19), P = 0.20; SMD = 0.14, 95%CI (-0.33, 0.60), P = 0.566; 
      SMD = 0.20, 95%CI (-0.04, 0.43), P = 0.099]. However, color vision with blue 
      light-filtering IOLs was significantly reduced in the blue light spectrum under 
      mesopic light conditions [SMD = 0.74, 95%CI (0.29, 1.18), P = 0.001]. CONCLUSION: 
      This meta-analysis demonstrates that postoperative visual performance with blue 
      light-filtering IOLs is approximately equal to that of UV light-filtering IOLs 
      after cataract surgery, but color vision with blue light-filtering IOLs 
      demonstrated some compromise in the blue light spectrum under mesopic light 
      conditions.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of correcting spherical aberration with 
      aspheric intraocular lenses (IOLs) in cataract surgery based on individual pupil 
      diameter. SETTING: Keio University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. METHODS: In this 
      prospective study, eyes having cataract surgery were divided into 4 groups based 
      on IOL type: aspheric SN (AcrySof SN60WF), aspheric ZA (Tecnis ZA9003), aspheric 
      PY (Hoya PY-60 AD), and spherical (AcrySof Natural SN60AT). Postoperative 
      higher-order aberrations (HOAs) of the cornea and whole eye and the pupil 
      diameter under photopic and mesopic conditions were measured. The HOA was 
      calculated using the individual pupil diameter. The correlation between corneal 
      and ocular spherical aberrations and pupil diameter was evaluated. RESULTS: Each 
      group comprised 30 eyes. Ocular spherical aberrations were significantly lower 
      than corneal spherical aberrations under mesopic conditions in the aspheric SN 
      group, the aspheric ZA group, and the aspheric PY group (P<.05); there was no 
      significant difference between the aberrations in the spherical group. Linear 
      regression showed significant correlations between postoperative corneal and 
      ocular spherical aberrations (beta = 0.39, aspheric SN; beta = 0.38, aspheric ZA; 
      beta = 0.58, aspheric PY; beta = 0.79, spherical). The differences in corneal and 
      ocular spherical aberrations were significantly correlated with pupil diameter in 
      the aspheric IOL groups but not in the spherical IOL group. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      amount of spherical aberration correction by aspheric IOLs varied depending on 
      IOL type and individual pupil diameter. The linear regression equation in this 
      study may make it possible to customize postoperative ocular spherical aberration 
      after cataract surgery.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the results of the first blue light-filtering photochromic 
      intraocular lens (IOL) and compare them with those of a regular yellow blue 
      light-filtering IOL and a clear ultraviolet-filtering IOL in human eyes under 
      various lighting conditions. SETTING: Beijing Tongren Eye Center, Beijing Tongren 
      Hospital, Capital Medical University; Beijing Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences Key 
      Laboratory, Beijing, China. DESIGN: Prospective comparative clinical study. 
      METHODS: This study evaluated eyes that had implantation of 1 of the following 3 
      IOLs: photochromic Aurium Matrix acrylic, model 400; yellow AF-1 (UY); or clear 
      MC611MI. All eyes were followed for 3 months. The uncorrected (UDVA) and 
      corrected (CDVA) distance visual acuities, contrast vision (lighting 400 lux, 30 
      lux, 5 lux), contrast sensitivity, color vision (Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test 
      under 400 lux, 30 lux), and patient questionnaire responses were evaluated. 
      RESULTS: The photochromic IOL group comprised 39 eyes; the yellow IOL group, 41 
      eyes; and the clear IOL group, 38 eyes. There were no significant differences 
      between the 3 IOLs in UDVA, CDVA, contrast sensitivity, or questionnaire 
      responses. The photochromic group had significantly better color vision than the 
      yellow IOL group at 30 lux and better contrast vision at 5% contrast (P < .05); 
      however, there were no significant differences between the photochromic IOL group 
      and the clear IOL group (P > .05). CONCLUSION: The photochromic blue 
      light-filtering IOL performed as well as the yellow and clear IOLs under photopic 
      conditions. Under mesopic conditions, the yellow IOL gave poor color vision and 
      contrast sensitivity.

TI  - Psychophysical measurement of the foveal avascular zone.
PG  - 405-10
AB  - The size of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) reflects the condition of the 
      microcapillary circulation in the foveal area. A number of studies have shown a 
      significant increase in FAZ size in conditions of vascular pathology including 
      diabetes. A non-invasive method of estimating FAZ size may be a valuable addition 
      to a psychophysical test battery. We used a blue-light field to reveal the 
      activity of the retinal leucocytes to two groups of normal subjects with average 
      ages 24 and 61 years. Two methods were used to estimate the FAZ size, making use 
      of the fact that subjects could see their own FAZ as the area free of leucocyte 
      activity. The first method required subjects to indicate when leucocyte activity 
      stopped as the field size was decreased and when it reappeared as field size was 
      increased. The second required subjects to match the size of the leucocyte-free 
      area with a white circle superimposed on the field. A search algorithm was used 
      to change circle size according to subjects' responses. Results show a 
      significant difference in FAZ size between the two age groups with both methods 
      of measurement, and estimates were comparable to those reported using 
      angiographic methods.

TI  - [The effect of blue light on mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome C of 
      cultured human retinal pigment epithelium cells].
PG  - 57-9, 96
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To answer the question whether mitochondrial permeability transition 
      (MPT) participates in blue light-induced damage to human retinal pigment 
      epithelium (RPE) cells, this study was directed at assessing the effect of blue 
      light on mitochondrial membrane potential (delta psi(m)) and cytochrome C (Cyt C) 
      of cultured human RPE cells. METHODS: Human RPE cells were exposed to blue light 
      (wave length 470-490 nm); delta psi(m) was measured by rhodamine 123 staining and 
      subsequent flow cytometry. Three groups were investigated: Group A (exposure to 
      different intensity of blue light); group B (exposure to identical intensity for 
      different duration); group C (exposure to identical intensity and duration, 
      different prolongation of post-exposure culture). Cyt C activity was assayed by 
      ELISA. Caspase-3 was detected by colorimetric assay. In these aspects, two groups 
      were investigated: Group I [(2000+/-500) 1x for 6 h]; Group II [(2000+/-500) 1x 
      for 12 h]. RESULTS: When human RPE cells were exposed to blue light, the more 
      pronounced decrease of delta psi(m) was consistent with the increase of light 
      intensity in group A. Pronounced decrease of delta psi(m) was seen at 6 h and 12 
      h of exposure duration in group B. At 6 h prolongation of post-exposure culture 
      in group C, the decrease of delta psi(m) was observed, lasting 48 h. The 
      concentration of Cyt C was detected; no significant changes were found at 6 h and 
      12 h prolongation of post-exposure culture, but a significant increase was found 
      at 24 h and 36 h post-exposure in the two groups. The increase was more 
      significant in Group II than in Group I at 24 h post-exposure. The activity 
      change of caspase-3 was not found in the two groups. CONCLUSION: Blue light 
      exposure over threshold can induce damage to human RPE cells, probably by 
      triggering the mitochondrial permeability transition, which results in the 
      decrease of delta psi(m) and the release of cytochrome C.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of homologues of plant blue-light photoreceptor 
      (cryptochrome) genes from the fern Adiantum capillus-veneris.
PG  - 345-53
AB  - Many blue-light mediated physiological responses have been studied in the fern 
      Adiantum capillus-veneris. We have isolated genomic clones encoding sequences 
      similar to those encoding blue-light photoreceptors (cryptochromes) in higher 
      plants using the Arabidopsis CRY1 cDNA as a probe, and these positive clones fall 
      into five independent groups. Using RACE procedures, we obtained full-length cDNA 
      sequences for three of these five groups. The deduced amino acid sequences 
      include the photolyase-homologous domain in the N-terminal half, and they also 
      contain a C-terminal extension of about 200 amino acids in length. These 
      structural features indicate that the genes indeed encode Adiantum cryptochromes 
      and represent a small gene family having at least three members.

TI  - [The protective effect of photochromic intraocular lens on visible light-induced 
      lesion in cultured retinal pigment epithelium].
PG  - 410-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the protective effect of photochromic intraocular lens 
      (IOL) on visible light-induced lesion in cultured retinal pigment epithelium 
      (RPE). METHODS: It was a experimental study. A human retinal pigment epithelium 
      cell line (ARPE-19) was used to study the protective role. Cells from the same 
      passage were divided into the control, light exposure only, light exposure plus 
      colorless IOL (FV-60A), light exposure plus photochromic IOL (BV-60A), light 
      exposure plus yellow IOL (Acrysof Natural IOL) groups. The treatments were 
      performed when the cells grew to 90% confluency. All cells were irradiated with 
      visible light at an illumination intensity of 60 000-61 000 lux. After the 
      treatments, we assessed 1: cells' viability by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) 
      assay; 2: the extent of apoptosis by terminal deoxynucleotidyl 
      transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), observing changes in the 
      ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and performing Hoechst 
      staining to measure the apoptosis index (AI); 3: examining vascular endothelial 
      growth factor (VEGF) and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) levels in the 
      culture medium by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: 
      Measurements of the cell viability of the five groups were (0.61 ± 0.01), (0.39 ± 
      0.01), (0.46 ± 0.01), (0.57 ± 0.01), and (0.58 ± 0.02), respectively. Apoptosis 
      was significantly activated by visible light as observed in TUNEL staining and 
      TEM. The AIs of the five groups were (0.99 ± 0.65)%, (9.28 ± 0.59)%, (6.54 ± 
      0.37)%, (4.69 ± 0.74)%, and (2.72 ± 0.67)%, respectively. The levels of VEGF in 
      the five groups were (3931.64 ± 25.26) ng/L, (5459.38 ± 42.69) ng/L, (4800.55 ± 
      42.12) ng/L, (4561.21 ± 46.27) ng/L, and (4420.35 ± 28.66) ng/L, respectively. 
      The levels of PEDF in the five groups were (182.85 ± 1.68) µg/L, (156.52 ± 0.64) 
      µg/L, (155.57 ± 3.43) µg/L, (167.57 ± 2.88) µg/L, and (170.90 ± 2.99) µg/L, 
      respectively. Comparing the photochromic IOL group with the yellow IOL group, 
      there was no difference in cell viability (q = 0.94) and PEDF levels (q = 1.51) 
      (P > 0.05), but there was a significant difference between the AI (q = 5.04) and 
      VEGF levels (q = 6.78) (P < 0.05). Comparing the photochromic IOL group with the 
      colorless IOL group, there were significant differences in cell viability (q = 
      18.92) , AI (q = 4.78) , VEGF (q = 11.52) and PEDF levels (q = 4.96) (P < 0.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Photochromic IOL can abate the degree of acute photodamage of RPE. 
      The protective efficiency was the highest when using the yellow Acrysof Natural 
      IOL, followed by photochromic IOL and colorless IOL.

TI  - Ocular aberrations and contrast sensitivity after cataract surgery with AcrySof 
      IQ intraocular lens implantation Clinical comparative study.
PG  - 1918-24
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether implantation of an intraocular lens (IOL) with a 
      modified posterior aspherical surface (AcrySof IQ, Alcon Surgical Laboratories) 
      results in reduced ocular aberrations (spherical aberration) and improved 
      contrast sensitivity after cataract surgery. SETTING: Brasilia Ophthalmologic 
      Hospital, Brasilia, and Sao Geraldo Eye Hospital, Federal University of Minas 
      Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil. METHODS: In an intraindividual randomized 
      prospective study of 25 patients with bilateral cataract, an IOL with a modified 
      posterior surface (AcrySof IQ) was compared with a biconvex IOL with spherical 
      surfaces (AcrySof Natural, Alcon). Ocular aberrations with a 5.0 mm and 6.0 mm 
      pupil were measured with a Hartmann-Shack aberrometer. Quality of vision was 
      measured by visual acuity and contrast sensitivity under mesopic and photopic 
      conditions. All patients were followed for 3 months. RESULTS: There were no 
      statistically significant differences between eyes in postoperative uncorrected 
      and best corrected distance visual acuities after a follow-up of 1 month and 3 
      months. Postoperatively, there was a statistically significant between-group 
      difference in contrast sensitivity under photopic conditions without glare at 18 
      cycles per degree (cpd) (P = .04) and under mesopic conditions without glare at 
      all spatial frequencies (3 cpd, 6 cpd, 12 cpd, and 18 cpd; P = .03, P = .009, P = 
      .003, and P = .003, respectively) and with glare at 3 cpd and 6 cpd (P = .001 and 
      P = .02, respectively). The difference in higher-order aberration (HOA) values 
      between groups was statistically significant with a 5.0 mm and 6.0 mm pupil, with 
      the AcrySof IQ IOL inducing less HOA than the AcrySof Natural IOL. Eyes with an 
      AcrySof IQ IOL also had statistically significant less spherical aberration than 
      eyes with an AcrySof Natural IOL with both pupil diameters (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: 
      The AcrySof IQ IOL with a modified posterior surface induced significantly less 
      HOA and spherical aberration than the AcrySof Natural IOL. Contrast sensitivity 
      was better under mesopic conditions with the AcrySof IQ IOL.

LID - 10.1038/eye.2008.122 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To look for objective and subjective differences between three types of 
      aspheric intraocular lens implants and their spherical counterparts. METHODS: 
      Thirty patients were randomised to receive one of six lens implants including 
      three aspheric lenses and their spherical counterparts. Pre and postoperative 
      testing was carried out including visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and 
      wavefront analysis. All patients were asked to fill in a visual function 
      questionnaire (modification of cataract TyPE) to assess subjective differences in 
      visual quality. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between groups for 
      best-corrected visual acuity. Contrast sensitivity testing showed the Tecnis lens 
      to perform better than the Cee-on Edge in all lighting conditions with 
      significant differences at 3 and/or 6 cycles/degree in three out of four lighting 
      conditions. No significant differences in contrast sensitivity were seen between 
      the other lens pairs. All aspheric lenses showed less spherical aberration than 
      their spherical pairs with statistical significance reached in two out of three 
      pairs (the Ceeon Edge vs Tecnis, and Acrysof Natural vs IQ). The questionnaire 
      revealed no evidence of improved subjective vision with the aspheric lenses 
      compared to the spherical lenses. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study concurs with 
      previously published trials in showing decreased spherical aberration and 
      improved contrast sensitivity with aspheric lenses compared to spherical lenses. 
      There was no evidence that the patients implanted with aspheric lenses rate their 
      quality of vision higher than those implanted with spherical lenses. Study 
      numbers were small and larger numbers may be required to demonstrate statistical 
      differences in subjective data.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare postoperative best distance visual acuity (VA), contrast 
      sensitivity and colour perception with the blue light-filtering AcrySof Natural 
      (SN60AT) and AcrySof single-piece (SA60AT) intraocular lenses (IOLs). METHODS: 
      This was a prospective, randomized, comparative, interventional study comparing 
      postoperative performance between the SN60 and SA60 IOLs. There were nine 
      patients (nine eyes) in the SN60 group and 10 patients (10 eyes) in the SA60 
      group. All patients were operated using phacoemulsification. Postoperative VA 
      (Snellen chart), contrast sensitivity (Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity chart) 
      and colour perception (Farnsworth-Munsell D-15 panel test) were measured at 1, 3 
      and 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS: Postoperative best corrected VA after 6 
      months was 20/20 or better in 89% of SN60 eyes and 100% of SA60 eyes. 
      Postoperative contrast sensitivity scores improved significantly in both groups 
      under both photopic and mesopic conditions. There were no statistically 
      significant differences in contrast sensitivity scores between the SN60 and SA60 
      groups at any of the postoperative evaluation time-points. Postoperative colour 
      perception improved significantly in both the SN60 and SA60 groups, and there 
      were no statistically significant differences in colour perception performance 
      between the two groups. CONCLUSION: The blue light-filtering AcrySof Natural 
      (SN60) IOL has postoperative visual performance comparable with that of the 
      AcrySof single-piece (SA60) IOL.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate contrast sensitivity function (CSF) and color vision after 
      implantation of either orange or yellow-tinted intraocular lenses (IOLs). 
      METHODS: Fifty-six eyes of 28 cataract patients who had bilateral implantation of 
      orange-tinted (PC440Y Orange, Ophtec), yellow-tinted (AcrySof Natural SN60AT, 
      Alcon), or clear (AcrySof SA60AT, Alcon) IOLs were examined. Six months 
      postoperatively, monocular CSF under photopic and mesopic (with and without 
      glare) conditions were measured using the Functional Visual Analyzer. Color 
      discrimination was determined with the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue test. RESULTS: 
      Patients implanted with orange-tinted, yellow-tinted, or clear IOLs displayed 
      similar CSF values, with no statistically significant differences at any spatial 
      frequency (p>0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in 
      chromatic discrimination among the 3 groups of patients (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Orange or yellow blue-filtering IOL implantation is comparable to a clear IOL in 
      terms of photopic and mesopic contrast sensitivity or color discrimination.

AB  - The functional principle of the vertebrate brain is often paralleled to a 
      computer: information collected by dedicated devices is processed and integrated 
      by interneuron circuits and leads to output. However, inter- and motorneurons 
      present in today's vertebrate brains are thought to derive from neurons that 
      combined sensory, integration, and motor function. Consistently, sensory 
      inter-motorneurons have been found in the simple nerve nets of cnidarians, 
      animals at the base of the evolutionary lineage. We show that light-sensory 
      motorneurons and light-sensory interneurons are also present in the brains of 
      vertebrates, challenging the paradigm that information processing and output 
      circuitry in the central brain is shielded from direct environmental influences. 
      We investigated two groups of nonvisual photopigments, VAL- and TMT-Opsins, in 
      zebrafish and medaka fish; two teleost species from distinct habitats separated 
      by over 300 million years of evolution. TMT-Opsin subclasses are specifically 
      expressed not only in hypothalamic and thalamic deep brain photoreceptors, but 
      also in interneurons and motorneurons with no known photoreceptive function, such 
      as the typeXIV interneurons of the fish optic tectum. We further show that 
      TMT-Opsins and Encephalopsin render neuronal cells light-sensitive. TMT-Opsins 
      preferentially respond to blue light relative to rhodopsin, with 
      subclass-specific response kinetics. We discovered that tmt-opsins co-express 
      with val-opsins, known green light receptors, in distinct inter- and 
      motorneurons. Finally, we show by electrophysiological recordings on isolated 
      adult tectal slices that interneurons in the position of typeXIV neurons respond 
      to light. Our work supports "sensory-inter-motorneurons" as ancient units for 
      brain evolution. It also reveals that vertebrate inter- and motorneurons are 
      endowed with an evolutionarily ancient, complex light-sensory ability that could 
      be used to detect changes in ambient light spectra, possibly providing the 
      endogenous equivalent to an optogenetic machinery.

AB  - To evaluate the effects of filtering short wavelength light on visual performance 
      under intense light conditions among pseudophakic patients previously implanted 
      with a clear intraocular lens (IOL). This was a patient-masked, randomized 
      crossover study conducted at 6 clinical sites in the United States between 
      September 2013 and January 2014. One hundred fifty-four bilaterally pseudophakic 
      patients were recruited. Photostress recovery time and glare disability 
      thresholds were measured with clip-on blue-light-filtering and placebo (clear; no 
      blue-light filtration) glasses worn over patients' habitual correction. 
      Photostress recovery time was quantified as the time necessary to regain sight of 
      a grating target after intense light exposure. Glare disability threshold was 
      assessed as the intensity of a white-light annulus necessary to obscure a central 
      target. The order of filter used and test eye were randomized across patients. 
      Photostress recovery time and glare disability thresholds were significantly 
      improved (both P < 0.0001) when patients used blue-light-filtering glasses 
      compared with clear, nonfiltering glasses. Compared with a nonfiltering placebo, 
      adding a clip-on blue-absorbing filter to the glasses of pseudophakic patients 
      implanted with clear IOLs significantly increased their ability to cope with 
      glare and to recover normal viewing after an intensive photostress. This result 
      implies that IOL designs with blue-light-filtering characteristics may be 
      beneficial under intense light conditions.

AB  - This study examined the effect of optic nerve disease, hence retinal ganglion 
      cell loss, on non-visual functions related to melanopsin signalling. Test 
      subjects were patients with bilateral visual loss and optic atrophy from either 
      hereditary optic neuropathy (n = 11) or glaucoma (n = 11). We measured melatonin 
      suppression, subjective sleepiness and cognitive functions in response to bright 
      light exposure in the evening. We also quantified the post-illumination pupil 
      response to a blue light stimulus. All results were compared to age-matched 
      controls (n = 22). Both groups of patients showed similar melatonin suppression 
      when compared to their controls. Greater melatonin suppression was 
      intra-individually correlated to larger post-illumination pupil response in 
      patients and controls. Only the glaucoma patients demonstrated a relative 
      attenuation of their pupil response. In addition, they were sleepier with slower 
      reaction times during nocturnal light exposure. In conclusion, glaucomatous, but 
      not hereditary, optic neuropathy is associated with reduced acute light effects. 
      At mild to moderate stages of disease, this is detected only in the pupil 
      function and not in responses conveyed via the retinohypothalamic tract such as 
      melatonin suppression.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the intensity of posterior capsular opacification (PCO) 
      between a 1-piece and a 3-piece microincision cataract surgery intraocular lens 
      (MICS IOL) in a prospective randomised study. METHODS: 80 eyes of 40 patients 
      with age-related cataract were enrolled in this study. Each patient received a 
      1-piece MICS IOL (AF-1 NY-60, Hoya, Tokyo, Japan) in one eye and a 3-piece MICS 
      IOL (AF-1 iMICS Y-60H, Tokyo, Hoya) in the other eye. At the 1-year follow-up, 
      the patients were examined at the slit lamp, visual acuity was determined and 
      standardised high-resolution digital retroillumination images were taken for 
      objective quantification of regeneratory PCO using an automated image analysis 
      software (AQUA). RESULTS: The mean regeneratory PCO score (1-piece IOL: 0.2, 
      3-piece IOL 0.3, p=0.7) and the neodymium:yttrium-aluminium-garnet laser 
      capsulotomy rate (two cases in 3-piece IOL group; p=0.5) were comparable low for 
      both IOLs. Capsular folds occurred significantly more often in the 3-piece IOL 
      group (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Modification of the MICS IOL from a 3-piece to a 
      1-piece haptic design caused in short term no significant change in PCO amount. 
      Compared with the 3-piece IOL, the 1-piece IOL led to significantly less capsular 
      folds 1 year after surgery.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare ocular wavefront aberrations for pupil 
      diameters of 4 mm and 6 mm, and contrast sensitivity, in eyes with AcrySof IQ and 
      AcrySof Natural intraocular lenses (IOLs). METHODS: Sixty eyes of 60 patients 
      were enrolled in this prospective randomized study. After phacoemulsification the 
      eyes received either AcrySof IQ SN60WF or AcrySof Natural SN60AT IOLs. One month 
      after surgery, all patients underwent complete ophthalmological examination 
      including corneal topography, wavefront analysis for pupil diameters of 4 mm and 
      6 mm, and contrast sensitivity measurements with the CSV 1000E instrument under 
      photopic and mesopic conditions with and without glare. RESULTS:  There was no 
      statistically significant difference between groups in age, sex or other 
      preoperative ocular characteristics (p > 0.05). Patients with AcrySof IQ IOLs had 
      higher contrast sensitivity at 6 c.p.d. under photopic conditions, at 6 c.p.d. 
      and 18 c.p.d. under mesopic conditions, and at 6 c.p.d., 12 c.p.d. and 18 c.p.d. 
      under mesopic conditions with glare (p < 0.05). Corneal spherical aberration was 
      0.273 ± 0.074 μm in the AcrySof Natural group and 0.294 ± 0.086 μm in the AcrySof 
      IQ group (p = 0489). Ocular spherical aberration was 0.362 ± 0.141 μm and 
      0.069 ± 0.043 μm (p < 0.001) for 6-mm diameter pupils and 0.143 ± 0.091 μm and 
      0.017 ± 0.016 μm (p < 0.001) for 4-mm diameter pupils, with AcrySof Natural and 
      AcrySof IQ IOLs, respectively. There were no significant differences in other 
      higher-order aberrations between the groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Aspherical 
      AcrySof IQ IOLs significantly reduced spherical aberration for pupil diameters of 
      both 4 mm and 6 mm and also improved contrast sensitivity more than spherical 
      AcrySof Natural IOLs, especially in mesopic conditions.

TI  - Glare disability, photostress recovery, and chromatic contrast: relation to 
      macular pigment and serum lutein and zeaxanthin.
PG  - 476-81
LID - 10.1167/iovs.12-10411 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: A large body of research has linked macular lutein and zeaxanthin to 
      reduced risk of degenerative eye disease. The earliest published hypothesis for 
      the role of the pigments was not based on chronic protection but immediate 
      function. Recent data on macular pigment (MP) have shown that screening the 
      foveal cones from short-wave light does, in fact, result in improvements in 
      photostress recovery (PR), glare disability (GD), and chromatic contrast (CC). 
      This study examined those relations on a larger sample. METHODS: A total of 150 
      young healthy subjects were assessed. Plasma samples were obtained from 100 
      subjects for HPLC quantification of serum xanthophylls. MP density was measured 
      using customized heterochromatic flicker photometery. GD, PR, and CC were 
      measured in Maxwellian view using a broadband xenon light source. GD was measured 
      by increasing the intensity of an annulus until it veiled a central target. PR 
      was measured as the time necessary to regain sight of a central target after a 
      5-second exposure to an intense bleaching light. CC was measured as the amount of 
      light necessary in a 460-nm background to lose sight of a central target. 
      RESULTS: MP density was significantly related to serum lutein and zeaxanthin 
      combined (r = 0.31, P = 0.002), GD (r = 0.24, P = 0.0015), PR (r = -0.18, P = 
      0.01), and CC (r = 0.46, P = 0.00005). CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm earlier 
      reports of a significant relation between variation in macular pigment optical 
      density and immediate effects on visual function. As with many species, 
      intraocular yellow filters in humans appear to improve many aspects of the visual 
      stimulus. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00909090.).

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare color perception after implantation of clear and 
      yellow-tinted intraocular lenses (IOLs). SETTING: Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre for 
      Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. 
      DESIGN: Comparative case series. METHODS: This study evaluated eyes that had 
      implantation of an Acrysof IQ SN60WF yellow-tinted IOL or an Acrysof SA60AT clear 
      IOL. All eyes were evaluated postoperatively at 1 month and 3 months. The 
      uncorrected distance visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and color vision 
      (Ishihara pseudoisochromatic test, Edridge-Green lantern test, Heidelberg 
      anomaloscope, and Farnsworth-Munsell (FM) 100-hue test) were evaluated. RESULTS: 
      Both IOL groups comprised 50 eyes. There were no significant differences between 
      the 2 groups in color vision on any of the 4 tests (P≥.05). Plotting the error 
      scores on the polarity graph of the FM 100-hue test showed that eyes with a 
      yellow-tinted IOL did not have a specific axis of confusion. CONCLUSION: There 
      was no difference in color perception between the 2 IOLs irrespective of the 
      color vision test used.

      media opacities.

AB  - The healthy adult human retina contains in its macular region a high 
      concentration of blue-light absorbing carotenoid compounds, known as macular 
      pigment (MP). Consisting of the carotenoids lutein, zeaxanthin, and 
      meso-zeaxanthin, the MP is thought to shield the vulnerable tissue layers in the 
      retina from lightinduced damage through its function as an optical attenuator and 
      to protect the tissue cells within its immediate vicinity through its function as 
      a potent antioxidant. Autofluorescence imaging (AFI) is emerging as a viable 
      optical method for MP screening of large subject populations, for tracking of MP 
      changes over time, and for monitoring MP uptake in response to dietary 
      supplementation. To investigate the influence of ocular media opacities on 
      AFI-based MP measurements, in particular, the influence of lens cataracts, we 
      conducted a clinical trial with a large subject population (93 subjects) measured 
      before and after cataract surgery. General AFI image contrast, retinal blood 
      vessel contrast, and presurgery lens opacity scores [Lens Opacities 
      Classification System III (LOCS III)] were investigated as potential predictors 
      for image degradation. These clinical results show that lens cataracts can 
      severely degrade the achievable pixel contrasts in the AFI images, which results 
      in nominal MP optical density levels that are artifactually reduced. While LOCS 
      III scores and blood vessel contrast are found to be only a weak predictor for 
      this effect, a strong correlation exists between the reduction factor and the 
      image contrast, which can be quantified via pixel intensity histogram parameters. 
      Choosing the base width of the histogram, the presence or absence of ocular media 
      opacities can be determined and, if needed, the nominal MP levels can be 
      corrected with factors depending on the strength of the opacity.

TI  - Intraocular lenses for the treatment of age-related cataracts: an evidence-based 
      analysis.
PG  - 1-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the report is to examine the comparative 
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of various intraocular lenses (IOLs) for the 
      treatment of age-related cataracts. CLINICAL NEED: TARGET POPULATION AND 
      CONDITION A cataract is a hardening and clouding of the normally transparent 
      crystalline lens that may result in a progressive loss of vision depending on its 
      size, location and density. The condition is typically bilateral, seriously 
      compromises visual acuity and contrast sensitivity and increases glare. Cataracts 
      can also affect people at any age, however, they usually occur as a part of the 
      natural aging process. The occurrence of cataracts increases with age from about 
      12% at age 50 years, to 60% at age 70. In general, approximately 50% of people 65 
      year of age or older have cataracts. Mild cataracts can be treated with a change 
      in prescription glasses, while more serious symptoms are treated by surgical 
      removal of the cataract and implantation of an IOL. In Ontario, the estimated 
      prevalence of cataracts increased from 697,000 in 1992 to 947,000 in 2004 (35.9% 
      increase, 2.4% annual increase). The number of cataract surgeries per 1,000 
      individuals at risk of cataract increased from 64.6 in 1992 to 140.4 in 1997 
      (61.9% increase, 10.1% annual increase) and continued to steadily increase to 
      115.7 in 2004 (10.7% increase, 5.2% increase per year). DESCRIPTION OF 
      TECHNOLOGY/THERAPY: IOLs are classified either as monofocal, multifocal, or 
      accommodative. Traditionally, monofocal (i.e.. fixed focusing power) IOLs are 
      available as replacement lenses but their implantation can cause a loss of the 
      eye's accommodative capability (which allows variable focusing). Patients thus 
      usually require eyeglasses after surgery for reading and near vision tasks. 
      Multifocal IOLs aim to improve near and distant vision and obviate the need for 
      glasses. Potential disadvantages include reduced contrast sensitivity, halos 
      around lights and glare. Accommodating IOLs are designed to move with ciliary 
      body contraction during accommodation and, therefore, offer a continuous range of 
      vision (i.e. near, intermediate and distant vision) without the need for glasses. 
      Purported advantages over multifocal IOLs include the avoidance of haloes and no 
      reduction in contrast sensitivity. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) was the first 
      material used in the fabrication of IOLs and has inherent ultraviolet blocking 
      abilities. PMMA IOLs are inflexible, however, and require a larger incision for 
      implantation compared with newer foldable silicone (hydrophobic) and acrylic 
      (hydrophobic or hydrophilic) lenses. IOLs can be further sub-classified as being 
      either aspheric or spheric, blue/violet filtered or non-filtered or 1- or 
      3-piece. METHODS OF EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS: A literature search was conducted 
      from January 2003 to January 2009 that included OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process 
      and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied 
      Health Literature (CINAHL), The Cochrane Library, and the International Agency 
      for Health Technology Assessment/Centre for Review and Dissemination. Inclusion

      of the studies was examined according to the GRADE Working Group criteria for 
      grading quality of evidence for interventional procedures. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: 
      The conclusions of the systematic review of IOLs for age-related cataracts are 
      summarized in Executive Summary Table 1. CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE ONTARIO HEALTH 
      SYSTEM: Procedures for crystalline lens removal and IOL insertion are insured and 
      listed in the Ontario Schedule of Benefits.If a particular lens is determined to 
      be medically necessary for a patient, the cost of the lens is covered by the 
      hospital budget. If the patient chooses a lens that has enhanced features, then 
      the hospital may choose to charge an additional amount above the cost of the 
      usual lens offered.An IOL manufacturer stated that monofocal lenses comprise 
      approximately 95% of IOL sales in Ontario and premium lenses (e.g., 
      multifocal/accomodative) consist of about 5% of IOL sales.A medical consultant 
      stated that all types of lenses are currently being used in Ontario (e.g., 
      multifocal, monofocal, accommodative, tinted, nontinted, spheric, and aspheric). 
      Nonfoldable lenses, rarely used in routine cases, are primarily used for 
      complicated cataract implantation situations.ES Table 1:Conclusions for the

PG  - 1243-8
LID - 10.1038/eye.2012.129 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To demonstrate the results of the ray tracing-type aberrometer in 
      measuring spherical aberration (SA) in pseudophakic eyes with monofocal 
      intraocular lens (IOL), aspheric monofocal IOL, or aspheric diffractive 
      multifocal IOL. METHODS: Total, corneal, and internal SA were measured using 
      iTrace at a 6-mm pupil size in 27 eyes of 27 patients implanted with a monofocal 
      spherical IOL (group 1: Natural, SN60AT), 30 eyes of 30 patients implanted with a 
      monofocal aspheric IOL (group 2: IQ, SN60WF), and 30 eyes of 30 patients 
      implanted with a multifocal aspheric IOL (group 3: ReSTOR, SN6AD1) at 3 months 
      after cataract surgery. We compared the internal SAs of these IOLs in pupil sizes 
      of 3, 4, 5, and 6 mm. RESULTS: There were no demographic statistically 
      significant differences among the groups. The internal SA of group 1 had a 
      positive value. The internal SA of group 2 was -0.175 ± 0.135 μm in 5-mm pupils 
      and -0.227 ± 0.253 μm in 6-mm pupils. The internal SA of group 3 was -0.072 ± 
      0.128 μm in 5-mm pupils and -0.173 ± 0.231 μm in 6-mm pupils. CONCLUSION: 
      Measuring internal SA with iTrace yields relatively accurate results in all types 
      of IOLs with adequate pupil sizes.

AB  - The objective of this study is to evaluate contrast sensitivity function (CSF) 
      after clear, yellow- and orange-tinted intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. This 
      was a prospective randomized study of 98 patients with senile cataract for a 
      period of 6 months from day 1 of August 2014 to day 31 of January 2015. After 
      phacoemulsification, 33 patients were implanted with clear IOLs (AcrySof 
      UV-filtering IOL, SA60AT), 32 patients were implanted with yellow coloured IOLs 
      (AcrySof Natural blue-light-attenuating and UV-filtering IOL, SN60AT with 
      IMPRUV(®) filter) and 33 patients were implanted with orange-tinted 
      blue-filtering IOLs (PC440Y Optech). After 1 month, monocular CSF was done under 
      photopic (85 cd/m(2)) and mesopic (3 cd/m(2)) illumination condition with 
      CSV-1000 test. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) after 1 month was 
      0.021 ± 0.058 logMAR for clear lens, 0.022 ± 0.059 logMAR for yellow lens and 
      0.019 ± 0.065 logMAR for orange lens (p = 0.989). Uniocular average photopic 
      contrast sensitivity was 1.36 ± 0.19, 1.43 ± 0.18 and 1.46 ± 0.15 log units for 
      clear lens, yellow lens and orange lens, respectively (statistically not 
      significant; p = 0.076). Average mesopic contrast sensitivity was 1.02 ± 0.21 log 
      units for clear lens, 1.00 ± 0.17 log units for yellow lens and 0.99 ± 0.15 log 
      units for orange lens (statistically not significant; p = 0.771). Yellow or 
      orange coloured blue-filtering IOLs are comparable to clear IOLs in terms of 
      photopic and mesopic contrast sensitivity.

TI  - Intramolecular proton transfers and structural changes during the photocycle of 
      the LOV2 domain of phototropin 1.
PG  - 724-31
AB  - The phototropins are a family of membrane-associated flavoproteins that function 
      as the primary blue light receptors regulating phototropism, chloroplast 
      movements, stomatal opening, and leaf expansion in plants. Phot1, a member of 
      this family, contains two FMN-binding domains, LOV1 and LOV2, within the 
      N-terminal region and a C-terminal serine-threonine protein kinase domain. Light 
      irradiation of oat phot1 LOV2 produces a cysteinyl adduct (Cys-39) at the flavin 
      C(4a) position, which decays thermally back to the dark state. We measured pH and 
      isotope effects on the photocycle. Between pH 3.7 and 9.5, adduct formation 
      showed minimal pH dependence, and adduct decay showed only slight pH dependence, 
      indicating that the pK values of mechanistically relevant groups are outside this 
      range. LOV2 showed a nearly 5-fold slowing of adduct formation in D(2)O relative 
      to H(2)O, indicating that the rate-limiting step involves proton transfer(s). 
      Light-induced changes in the far UV CD spectrum of LOV2 revealed putative protein 
      structural perturbations. The light minus dark CD difference spectrum resembles 
      an inverted alpha-helix spectrum, suggesting that alpha-helicity is reversibly 
      lost upon light irradiation. Decay kinetics for CD spectral changes in the far UV 
      region occur at the same rate as those in the visible region, indicating 
      synchronous relaxation of protein and chromophore structures.

TI  - Establishment of a blue light damage model of human retinal pigment epithelial 
      cells in vitro.
LID - 10.4238/gmr.15028092 [doi]
AB  - To establish a blue-light damage model of human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). 
      Fourth-generation human RPE cells were randomly divided into two groups. In group 
      A, cells were exposed to blue light (2000 ± 500 lux) for 0 (control), 3, 6, 9, 
      and 12 h, and cell culture was stopped after 12 h. In group B, cells were exposed 
      to blue light at the same intensity and time periods, but cell culture was 
      stopped after 24 h. TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay was 
      performed to determine the most suitable illuminating time with apoptotic index. 
      Flow cytometry was used to determine apoptotic ratio of RPEs. In group A, the 
      apoptotic index of cells that received 6, 9 and 12 h of blue light was higher 
      than that of control. The apoptotic index of cells receiving 9 and 12 h was 
      higher than that of 6 h (P = 0.000). In group B, the apoptotic index and RPE cell 
      apoptosis ratio of cells exposed to 6, 9 and 12 h of blue light were higher than 
      that of 3 h (P = 0.000); and cells receiving 9 and 12 h had higher values than 
      that of 6 h. This study demonstrated that the best conditions to establish a blue 
      light damage model of human retinal pigment epithelial cells in vitro are 2000 ± 
      500 lux light intensity for 6 h, with 24 h of cell culture post-exposure.

TI  - Protective Effect of Fucoxanthin Isolated from Laminaria japonica against Visible 
      Light-Induced Retinal Damage Both in Vitro and in Vivo.
PG  - 416-24
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.5b05436 [doi]
AB  - With increasingly serious eye exposure to light stresses, such as light-emitting 
      diodes, computers, and widescreen mobile phones, efficient natural compounds for 
      preventing visible light-induced retinal damages are becoming compelling needs in 
      the modern society. Fucoxanthin, as the main light absorption system in marine 
      algae, may possess an outstanding bioactivity in vision protection because of its 
      filtration of blue light and excellent antioxidative activity. In this work, both 
      in vitro and in vivo simulated visible light-induced retinal damage models were 
      employed. The in vitro results revealed that fucoxanthin exhibited better 
      bioactivities than lutein, zeaxanthin, and blueberry anthocyanins in inhibiting 
      overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor, resisting senescence, 
      improving phagocytic function, and clearing intracellular reactive oxygen species 
      in retinal pigment epithelium cells. The in vivo experiment also confirmed the 
      superiority of fucoxanthin than lutein in protecting retina against photoinduced 
      damage. This excellent bioactivity may be attributed to its unique structural 
      features, including allenic, epoxide, and acetyl groups. Fucoxanthin is expected 
      to be an important ocular nutrient in the future.

TI  - Does pupil constriction under blue and green monochromatic light exposure change 
      with age?
PG  - 257-64
LID - 10.1177/0748730412441172 [doi]
AB  - Many nonvisual functions are regulated by light through a photoreceptive system 
      involving melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells that are maximally 
      sensitive to blue light. Several studies have suggested that the ability of light 
      to modulate circadian entrainment and to induce acute effects on melatonin 
      secretion, subjective alertness, and gene expression decreases during aging, 
      particularly for blue light. This could contribute to the documented changes in 
      sleep and circadian regulatory processes with aging. However, age-related 
      modification in the impact of light on steady-state pupil constriction, which 
      regulates the amount of light reaching the retina, is not demonstrated. We 
      measured pupil size in 16 young (22.8±4 years) and 14 older (61±4.4 years) 
      healthy subjects during 45-second exposures to blue (480 nm) and green (550 nm) 
      monochromatic lights at low (7×10(12) photons/cm2/s), medium (3×10(13) 
      photons/cm2/s), and high (10(14) photons/cm2/s) irradiance levels. Results showed 
      that young subjects had consistently larger pupils than older subjects for dark 
      adaptation and during all light exposures. Steady-state pupil constriction was 
      greater under blue than green light exposure in both age groups and increased 
      with increasing irradiance. Surprisingly, when expressed in relation to baseline 
      pupil size, no significant age-related differences were observed in pupil 
      constriction. The observed reduction in pupil size in older individuals, both in 
      darkness and during light exposure, may reduce retinal illumination and 
      consequently affect nonvisual responses to light. The absence of a significant 
      difference between age groups for relative steady-state pupil constriction 
      suggests that other factors such as tonic, sympathetic control of pupil dilation, 
      rather than light sensitivity per se, account for the observed age difference in 
      pupil size regulation. Compared to other nonvisual functions, the light 
      sensitivity of steady-state pupil constriction appears to remain relatively 
      intact and is not profoundly altered by age.

TI  - The effect of blue-blocking intraocular lenses on circadian biological rhythm: 
      protocol for a randomised controlled trial (CLOCK-IOL colour study).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Blue light information plays an important role in synchronising 
      internal biological rhythm within the external environment. Circadian 
      misalignment is associated with the increased risk of sleep disturbance, obesity, 
      diabetes mellitus, depression, ischaemic heart disease, stroke and cancer. 
      Meanwhile, blue light causes photochemical damage to the retina, and may be 
      associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). At present, clear 
      intraocular lenses (IOLs) and blue-blocking IOLs are both widely used for 
      cataract surgery; there is currently a lack of randomised controlled trials to 
      determine whether clear or blue-blocking IOLs should be used. METHODS AND 
      ANALYSIS: This randomised controlled trial will recruit 1000 cataract patients 
      and randomly allocate them to receive clear IOLs or blue-blocking IOLs in a ratio 
      of 1:1. The primary outcomes are mortality and the incidence of cardiovascular 
      disease, cancer and AMD. Secondary outcomes are fasting plasma glucose, 
      triglycerides, cholesterol, glycated haemoglobin, sleep quality, daytime 
      sleepiness depressive symptoms, light sensitivity, the circadian rhythm of 
      physical activity, wrist skin temperature and urinary melatonin metabolite. 
      Primary outcomes will be followed until 20 years after surgery, and secondary 
      outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 1 year after surgery. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from the Institutional Review 
      Board of Nara Medical University (No. 13-032). The findings of this study will be 
      communicated to healthcare professionals, participants and the public through 
      peer-reviewed publications, scientific conferences and the University Hospital 
      Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN-CTR) home page. TRIAL

TI  - Sleep disturbances are related to decreased transmission of blue light to the 
      retina caused by lens yellowing.
PG  - 1215-9
LID - 10.5665/SLEEP.1242 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Sleep pattern and circadian rhythms are regulated via the 
      retinohypothalamic tract in response to stimulation of a subset of retinal 
      ganglion cells, predominantly by blue light (450-490 nm). With age, the 
      transmission of blue light to the retina is reduced because of the aging process 
      of the human lens, and this may impair the photoentrainment of circadian rhythm 
      leading to sleep disorders. The aim of the study was to examine the association 
      between lens aging and sleep disorders. DESIGN: Cross-sectional population based 
      study. SETTING: The study was performed at the Research Center for Prevention and 
      Health, Glostrup Hospital, Denmark and at the Department of Ophthalmology, Herlev 
      Hospital, Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: An age- and sex-stratified sample of 970 persons 
      aged 30 to 60 years of age drawn from a sample randomly selected from the 
      background population. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: 
      Sleep disturbances were evaluated by a combination of questionnaire and the use 
      of prescription sleeping medication. Lens aging (transmission and yellowing) was 
      measured objectively by lens autofluorometry. The risk of sleep disturbances was 
      significantly increased when the transmission of blue light to the retina was 
      low, even after correction for the effect of age and other confounding factors 
      such as smoking habits, diabetes mellitus, gender, and the risk of ischemic heart 
      disease (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Filtration of blue light by the aging lens was 
      significantly associated with an increased risk of sleep disturbances. We propose 
      that this is a result of disturbance of photoentrainment of circadian rhythms.

PG  - 593-6
AB  - In a prospective study, designed to test the effect of intraocular lenses 
      containing an ultraviolet absorbing chromophore on the incidence of 
      post-operative cystoid macular oedema, 55 patients undergoing extracapsular 
      cataract extraction were randomly allocated to receive intraocular lenses with or 
      without an ultra-violet absorbing chromophore. Post-operative fluorescein 
      angiography showed no difference in the incidence of macular oedema in those 
      patients receiving an intraocular lens with an ultraviolet absorbing chromophore 
      compared with patients receiving a standard posterior chamber intraocular lens.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare posterior capsule opacification (PCO) between 2 microincision 
      hydrophilic intraocular lenses (IOLs) and with a conventional spherical 
      hydrophobic IOL. SETTING: St. Thomas' Hospital, London, United Kingdom. DESIGN: 
      Prospective randomized comparative study. METHODS: A microincision Acri.Smart 36A 
      (negatively aspheric) or Akreos MI-60 (aspherically neutral) IOL was randomized 
      to the first eye of patients with the alternative IOL implanted in the fellow eye 
      within 3 weeks. Postoperatively, 100% and 9% logMAR corrected distance visual 
      acuity (CDVA) were assessed. Retroillumination photographs were analyzed using 
      the posterior capsule opacity software system. The data on PCO scores were 
      compared with those of a conventional spherical hydrophobic IOL (Acrysof SN60AT). 
      RESULTS: One hundred percent CDVA was significantly better at 12 months and 9% 
      CDVA was better at 6, 12, and 24 months (P<.05) with the negatively aspheric IOL. 
      One eye in each group with microincision IOLs developed capsule phimosis at 1 
      month. Neodymium:YAG capsulotomies were required by 2 years in 2 eyes with a 
      negatively aspheric IOL and 8 eyes with an aspherically neutral IOL. At 24 
      months, the mean PCO score remained less than 10% with the conventional spherical 
      IOL, whereas it increased with time in the negatively aspheric IOL (up to 16%) 
      and the aspherically neutral IOL (up to 23%). CONCLUSIONS: The negatively 
      aspheric IOL had a better PCO profile than the aspherically neutral IOL. This may 
      be attributed to the difference in the edge design between the IOLs. The 
      microincision IOLs had more PCO than the conventional 1-piece hydrophobic IOL.

TI  - Effect of intraocular lens asphericity on posterior capsule opacification between 
      two intraocular lenses with same acrylic material: a fellow-eye study.
PG  - e104-8
LID - 10.1111/j.1755-3768.2011.02286.x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate intra-individual differences in posterior capsule 
      opacification (PCO) and visual performance between spherical AcrySof SN60AT and 
      an aspheric AcrySof SN60WF intraocular lens (IOL) with a posterior aspheric 
      surface, both of which are made of same hydrophobic acrylic material. SETTING: 
      Ophthalmology Department, St Thomas' Hospital, London, UK. METHODS: In this 
      prospective randomized, fellow-eye comparison, an aspheric IOL, which is 9% 
      thinner in comparison with the spherical IOL, was randomized to the first eye of 
      47 patients and fellow-eye surgery was performed within 3 weeks. Follow-up was at 
      1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Corrected logMAR visual acuity (CDVA) was measured at 
      100% and 9% contrast. After pupil dilation, digital retroillumination photographs 
      were taken and the mean PCO percentage was calculated using poco software at each 
      follow-up visit. RESULTS: At 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months, 47 (94 eyes), 44 (88 
      eyes), 42 (84 eyes) and 41 (82 eyes) patients were followed-up respectively. 
      Hundred per cent and 9% of LogMAR CDVA was not significantly different between 
      the two IOLs (p = NS at all time-points). Percentage area PCO scores (mean ± SD) 
      at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months with the spherical IOL was 5.82 ± 9.89, 7.76 ± 
      16.83, 7.21 ± 12.46, 9.29 ± 18.25 and 14.39 ± 25.42, respectively, and with an 
      aspheric IOL was 8.91 ± 12.79, 5.97 ± 10.32, 5.15 ± 7.92, 7.68 ± 11.18 and 12.18 
      ± 20.10, respectively (p = NS at all time-points). CONCLUSIONS: Posterior capsule 
      opacification was not significantly different between the spheric and aspheric 
      IOLs in this fellow-eye, randomized comparison. Additional asphericity on the 
      existing model of IOL does not influence PCO performance.

TI  - Blue light-filter intraocular lenses in vitrectomy combined with cataract 
      surgery: results of a randomized controlled clinical trial.
PG  - 499-503
LID - 10.1016/j.ajo.2007.10.021 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of the blue light-filter intraocular lenses 
      (IOLs) in vitrectomy combined with cataract surgery, focusing on the surgeon's 
      ability to perform specific vitreoretinal procedures and on the patients' 
      outcome. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. METHODS: Sixty patients, recruited 
      from our outpatient department, were assigned randomly to receive an 
      ultraviolet-filter IOL (clear IOL group) or a blue light-filter IOL (yellow IOL 
      group) combined with a vitreoretinal procedure. Main outcome measures were 
      intraoperative conditions for the surgeon and the functional outcome. Second 
      outcome measures were complication rates and vitreoretinal diagnoses. RESULTS: 
      The questionnaire responses showed that the blue light-filter IOLs did not 
      represent an impediment to vitreoretinal surgery (P>.05). No intraoperative 
      complications were encountered in either group. Patients in both IOL groups 
      showed comparable functional results with respect to visual acuity, contrast 
      sensitivity, color vision, and glare effect (P>.05). The functional outcome was 
      influenced significantly by the vitreoretinal diagnosis (P<.01). CONCLUSIONS: 
      With the possible advantage of macular protection and no intraoperative or 
      functional disadvantage, the routine use of the blue light-filter IOL in combined 
      surgery can be recommended.

TI  - Cone function in children with a history of preterm birth.
PG  - 141-8
LID - 10.1007/s10633-011-9268-z [doi]
AB  - Color vision was examined by psychophysical tests and photopic color full-field 
      electroretinography (ERG) in formerly preterm children, and compared with those 
      of full-term children. In a prospective case-control study, 25 patients with a 
      history of preterm birth 7-14 years of age were divided into three groups: group 
      I, laser-treated retinopathy of prematurity [ROP] (n = 7); group II, 
      spontaneously regressed ROP (n = 8); group III, no ROP (n = 10). Age-matched 
      full-term born children comprised the control group (n = 8). Color vision was 
      assessed by Fansworth D15 and Lanthony desaturated D15 tests. The cone function 
      was tested using photopic full-field ERG. Besides the ISCEV standard stimuli, 
      blue light on amber background was also used (S-cone ERG). The correlation 
      between ERG parameters and prematurity or ROP was determined. We found no 
      significant differences between any patient group and the control group in the 
      results of the psychophysical tests, and implicit times of the ERG responses. The 
      ERG b-wave amplitudes were significantly lower in group I (laser-treated ROP) 
      compared to controls, for 2 of 4 stimulus conditions i.e. the standard (P = 
      0.028) and S-cone (P = 0.017) single flash ERGs. The general estimating equation 
      model statistics found a significant effect of prematurity on the b-wave 
      amplitudes (P = 0.025, standard, P = 0.014, S-cone ERG). A slightly reduced 
      photopic ERG b-wave amplitude may be associated with prematurity.

TI  - Contrast sensitivity and spherical aberration in eyes implanted with AcrySof IQ 
      and AcrySof Natural intraocular lens: the results of a meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To systematically evaluate the visual performance of aspheric AcrySof 
      IQ and spherical AcrySof Natural intraocular lens (IOL) after cataract surgery. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Potential randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
      that involved implanting AcrySof IQ and AcrySof Natural were searched from 
      PubMed, Web of science, EMBASE, Chinese Science and Technology Periodicals 
      Databases and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The methodological 
      quality of the studies was assessed by the Jadad method. Standardized mean 
      differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of best-corrected visual 
      acuity (BCVA), contrast sensitivity and spherical aberration were pooled using a 
      random-effects model. Seven studies were identified and analyzed to compare 
      AcrySof IQ (236 eyes) with AcrySof Natural (232 eyes) after phacoemulsification. 
      There was no significant difference in postoperative BCVA between AcrySof IQ and 
      AcrySof Natural (p =0.137) after a follow up of 3 months. For contrast 
      sensitivity, these differences reached statistical significance under photopic 
      conditions at two spatial frequencies (3 cycles per degree (cpd), 6 cpd, 12 cpd, 
      and 18 cpd; p =0.022, p =0.017, p = 0.065, and p=0.191, respectively) and under 
      mesopic conditions at three spatial frequencies (3 cpd, 6 cpd, 12 cpd, and 18 
      cpd; p =0.007, p =0.033, p =0.030, and p =0.080, respectively). Eyes with AcrySof 
      IQ also had statistically significant less spherical aberration than eyes with 
      AcrySof Natural (p<0.001). Sensitivity analysis showed that the results were 
      relatively stable and reliable. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The overall findings 
      indicate that AcrySof IQ with a modified aspheric surface induced significantly 
      less spherical aberration than AcrySof Natural. Contrast sensitivity in eyes with 
      AcrySof IQ is better than that in eyes with AcrySof Natural, especially under 
      mesopic conditions.

TI  - Visual function in patients with yellow tinted intraocular lenses compared with 
      vision in patients with non-tinted intraocular lenses.
PG  - 1019-23
AB  - AIM: To compare the visual function in patients with short wavelength blue light 
      blocking yellow tinted intraocular lenses (IOLs) with that in patients with 
      non-tinted IOLs. METHODS: 74 patients scheduled for bilateral cataract surgery 
      underwent implantation of either yellow IOLs (HOYA YA60BB) or non-tinted IOLs 
      (VA60BB) in both eyes. Contrast visual acuity with and without a glare source was 
      measured under photopic (100 cd/m2) and mesopic (slightly higher luminance than 
      typically used-5 cd/m2) conditions at 2 weeks and 3 months after surgery using 
      the contrast sensitivity accurate tester. Visual acuity and the incidence of 
      patients who noted cyanopsia were also examined. RESULTS: No significant 
      differences between the yellow tinted and non-tinted IOL groups were observed in 
      mean visual acuity or in photopic or higher luminance mesopic contrast visual 
      acuity with and without glare source at either 2 weeks or 3 months after surgery. 
      Furthermore, there was no significant difference in contrast visual acuity loss 
      as a result of glare. The incidence of patients who noticed cyanopsia was 
      significantly less in the yellow tinted IOL group than in the non-tinted IOL 
      group at 2 weeks after surgery (p = 0.0234), but no patients reported cyanopsia 
      at 3 months. CONCLUSION: Visual function in patients with yellow tinted IOLs is 
      virtually the same as that in patients with non-tinted IOLs.

AB  - PURPOSE: To clinically evaluate postoperative changes in the transparency of 
      hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lenses (IOLs). SETTING: Department of 
      Ophthalmology, Dokkyo Medical University, Tochigi, Japan. DESIGN: Case-control 
      study. METHODS: Eyes having phacoemulsification were randomly assigned to have 
      implantation of 1 of 3 hydrophobic acrylic IOL models. The IOLs were photographed 
      at 0 degree and 90 degrees 1 week, 6 months, and 1 year after implantation using 
      a Nidek EAS-1000 anterior chamber analyzer in slit mode. The images were used to 
      determine the intensity of light scattering in the surface and middle regions of 
      the IOL optic. RESULTS: The study comprised 65 eyes of 57 patients with a mean 
      age of 72.5 years. The rate of increase in light-scattering intensity was similar 
      in the middle and surface regions of the Tecnis ZA9003 aspheric IOL. The increase 
      in light-scattering intensity in both regions of the AF-1 VA-60BB spherical IOL 
      was greater than that in the aspheric IOL at all the measurement points. The 
      intensity of light scattering was highest and tended to increase over time in 
      both regions of the AcrySof SA60AT spherical IOL; the rate of increase in 
      intensity was higher in the surface region than in the middle region, and the 
      difference was significantly greater at 6 months and 1 year than at 1 week. 
      CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that AcrySof SA60AT and AF-1 VA-60BB IOLs are 
      likely to develop glistenings over time and that the former may develop 
      whitening.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine vision quality when testing two acrylic intraocular 
      lenses, AcrySof IQ and AcrySof Natural, after routine cataract extraction and IOL 
      implantation. METHOD: Prospective, randomized, double-masked study that 260 eyes 
      of patients who underwent cataract extraction and IOL implantation was performed. 
      Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: AcrySof IQ or AcrySof Natural. One 
      week, one and three month postoperative evaluations included contrast sensitivity 
      and wavefront analysis. The independent-samples T test was used. P < 0.05 was 
      considered statistically significant. RESULT: The AcrySof IQ group has 
      significantly higher and middle spatial frequency of contrast sensitivity. The 
      difference in low spatial frequency was getting significant along with time. 
      Patients with AcrySof IQ had a reduction in total high-order aberrations and 
      spherical aberration. There were no difference in coma between two groups. 
      CONCLUSION: The use of aspheric acrylic AcrySof IQ IOL may improve the quality of 
      vision as a result of the reduction of contrast sensitivity and spherical 
      aberration.

TI  - The effects of coloured light filter overlays on reading rates in age-related 
      macular degeneration.
PG  - 695-700
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the effect of coloured light filter overlays on reading 
      rates for people with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). METHOD: Using a 
      prospective clinical trial design, we examined the null hypothesis that coloured 
      light filter overlays do not improve reading rates in AMD when compared to a 
      clear filter. Reading rates for 12 subjects with non-exudative AMD, associated 
      with a relative scotoma and central fixation (mean age 81 years, SD 5.07 years) 
      were determined using the Rate of Reading Test (printed, nonsense, lower case 
      sans serif, stationary text) with 10 different, coloured light filter overlays 
      (Intuitive Overlays); figures in brackets are percentage transmission values); 
      rose (78%), pink (78%), purple (67%), aqua (81%), blue (74%), lime-green (86%), 
      mint-green (85%), yellow (93%), orange (83%) and grey (71%). A clear overlay 
      (Roscolene # 00) (360 cdm-2) with 100% transmittance was used as a control. 
      RESULTS: Anova indicated that there was no statistically significant difference 
      in reading rates with the coloured light filter overlays compared to the clear 
      filter. Furthermore, chi-squared analysis indicated that the rose, purple and 
      blue filters had a significantly poorer overall ranking in terms of reading rates 
      compared to the other coloured and clear light filters. CONCLUSION: Coloured 
      light filter overlays are unlikely to provide a clinically significant 
      improvement in reading rates for people with non-exudative AMD associated with a 
      relative scotoma and central fixation.

TI  - Impact of cataract surgery on sleep in patients receiving either 
      ultraviolet-blocking or blue-filtering intraocular lens implants.
PG  - 4999-5004
LID - 10.1167/iovs.14-14054 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Although visual impairment is a well-recognized consequence of cataract 
      development, little is known about the ability of the melanopsin-based 
      photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs) to regulate sleep-wake timing in 
      the presence of cataract. In this study, we replaced a cataractous natural 
      crystalline lens with two different types of artificial intraocular lenses, a 
      UV-blocking lens or a blue-filtering lens. We investigated the level of sleep 
      disturbance before cataract surgery and any change in sleep due to improved light 
      transmission following surgery and compared this in both types of intraocular 
      lens. METHODS: Quality of sleep in 961 patients undergoing cataract surgery was 
      assessed by administering the validated self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality 
      Index (PSQI) questionnaire. The PSQI distinguishes good sleepers from poor 
      sleepers by scoring seven different sleep components over the last month, which 
      are combined to produce an overall score for sleep quality. Patients received 
      either an ultraviolet-blocking (UVB) clear intraocular lens (IOL) or a 
      blue-filtering (BF) IOL. Questionnaires were completed four times: 1 month 
      preoperatively and again 1, 6 (UVB-IOL only), and 12 months postoperatively. 
      RESULTS: Half of the patients reported poor sleep in the presence of cataract in 
      both the UVB-IOL (mean PSQI = 6.35; SD = 3.82) and BF-IOL (mean PSQI = 6.39; SD = 
      4.04) groups. Cataract removal improved overall sleep quality significantly 1 
      month postoperatively in the UVB-IOL (mean PSQI = 5.89; SD = 3.71) and BF-IOL 
      (mean PSQI = 6.08; SD = 3.88) groups. Sleep latency also improved for the UVB-IOL 
      (preoperative mean = 1.16; SD = 1.003) and BF-IOL (preoperative mean = 1.17; SD = 
      1.03) groups at 1 month (UVB-IOL group mean = 1.01; SD = 0.923 and BF-IOL group 
      mean = 1.00; SD = 0.95), which was sustained at 6 months for the UVB-IOL group 
      (mean = 1.02; SD = 0.93) and 12 months for both the UVB-IOL and BF-IOL groups (6 
      months: UVB-IOL group mean = 0.96; SD = 0.92 and for the BF-IOL group mean = 
      0.99; SD = 0.96). CONCLUSIONS: Overall sleep quality and sleep latency improves 
      after removal of cataract irrespective of the type of IOL implanted. These data 
      show that implantation of BF-IOL does not have a negative impact on the 
      sleep-wake cycle.

TI  - Effects of a chronic reduction of short-wavelength light input on melatonin and 
      sleep patterns in humans: evidence for adaptation.
PG  - 690-7
LID - 10.3109/07420528.2014.893242 [doi]
AB  - Light is an important environmental stimulus for the entrainment of the circadian 
      clock and for increasing alertness. The intrinsically photosensitive ganglion 
      cells in the retina play an important role in transferring this light information 
      to the circadian system and they are elicited in particular by short-wavelength 
      light. Exposure to short wavelengths is reduced, for instance, in elderly people 
      due to yellowing of the ocular lenses. This reduction may be involved in the 
      disrupted circadian rhythms observed in aged subjects. Here, we tested the 
      effects of reduced blue light exposure in young healthy subjects (n = 15) by 
      using soft orange contact lenses (SOCL). We showed (as expected) that a reduction 
      in the melatonin suppressing effect of light is observed when subjects wear the 
      SOCL. However, after chronic exposure to reduced (short wavelength) light for two 
      consecutive weeks we observed an increase in sensitivity of the melatonin 
      suppression response. The response normalized as if it took place under a 
      polychromatic light pulse. No differences were found in the dim light melatonin 
      onset or in the amplitude of the melatonin rhythms after chronic reduced blue 
      light exposure. The effects on sleep parameters were limited. Our results 
      demonstrate that the non-visual light system of healthy young subjects is capable 
      of adapting to changes in the spectral composition of environmental light 
      exposure. The present results emphasize the importance of considering not only 
      the short-term effects of changes in environmental light characteristics.

      acrylic intraocular lenses.
PG  - 1140-6
LID - 10.1016/j.jcrs.2012.01.031 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the incidence of glistenings in a large series of 
      consecutive eyes with a blue light-filtering hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lens 
      (IOL) and the relationship with parameters such as age, sex, follow-up length, 
      and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA). SETTING: Service d'Ophtalmologie, 
      Centre Hospitalier et Universitaire Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France. DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional study. METHODS: This study included 111 eyes of 74 patients (age 
      range 33 to 86 years). All cases had cataract surgery with Acrysof SN60WF 
      monofocal IOL implantation and had a routine postoperative examination between 
      March 2011 and June 2011. The incidence and severity of glistenings were 
      evaluated with the slitlamp. Also evaluated was their relationship with age, sex, 
      follow-up length, IOL power, and CDVA. Glistenings were subjectively graded (0 = 
      absent; 1 = moderate; 2 = dense). RESULTS: Glistenings occurred in 96 eyes 
      (86.5%). Glistenings were of grade 1 severity in 45 eyes (40.5%) and of grade 2 
      severity in 51 eyes (45.9%). The follow-up was significantly longer in eyes with 
      grade 2 glistenings (P ≤ .01). A limited, but significant, correlation was found 
      between glistening severity and length of follow-up (r = 0.32, P<.01). Although 
      there was a trend toward decreased visual acuities at higher glistening grades (r 
      = 0.22, P = .01), there were no significant differences in CDVA between the 
      glistening severity groups (P = .14). CONCLUSIONS: Glistenings were common in 
      eyes with the blue light-filtering hydrophobic acrylic IOL and increased over 
      time. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE: No author has a financial or proprietary interest in

TI  - AcrySof Natural SN60AT versus AcrySof SA60AT intraocular lens in patients with 
      color vision defects.
PG  - 2324-8
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether implantation of the AcrySof Natural intraocular 
      lens (IOL) worsened the severity of existing color deficit in congenital partial 
      red-green color deficient individuals (CPRG). METHODS: A prospective controlled 
      randomized double-masked analysis of 30 consecutive patients with CPRG defect and 
      bilateral cataracts received a Natural IOL (test group) in 1 eye and a 
      single-piece AcrySof IOL (control group) in the other eye. Patients were tested 
      unilaterally to detect CPRG defect using Ishihara pseudoisochromatic plates and 
      the Farnsworth D-15 test. Plates 1 to 21 measured the Ishihara error score; 
      plates 22 to 25 indicated severity of defect based on clarity of both numerals as 
      partial mild/moderate (both visible), partial severe defect (only 1 visible). The 
      D-15 test is based on number of diametrical crossings on the circular diagram; 
      severity is graded as mild (1 crossing), moderate (2 crossings), or severe (>2 
      crossings). Tests were performed before and after IOL implantation at 1, 3, and 6 
      months. At mean follow-up of 6.13 months +/- 1.2 (SD), analysis of variance test 
      judged the difference in error scores and cross tabulation represented change in 
      number of diametrical crossings. RESULTS: The mean age was 62.3 +/- 8.5 years. 
      All patients were men. Before IOL implantation, all patients had moderate CPRG 
      defect on both tests. The Ishihara error score in the test and control groups did 
      not reveal statistically significant differences (P = .505 and P = .119, 
      respectively). With D-15, none of the patients in the test or control group 
      showed >2 crossings. CONCLUSION: The implantation of AcrySof Natural IOL did not 
      worsen the preexisting severity of color defect in CPRG individuals.

TI  - Tinting effect of ultraviolet radiation on intraocular lenses of polymethyl 
      methacrylate.
PG  - 1-16
AB  - Intraocular lenses (IOL) made of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) lack an important 
      yellowish pigment useful as a filter in the visual process and in the protection 
      of the retina from short wavelength light. It was found that the PMMA used for 
      IOL manufacturing can be tinted by dry exposure to mercury near-UV emitting lamp 
      (emission maximum, 365 nm, light bandwidth +/- 140 nm; irradiance of 50-100 W/sq 
      m as measured at the PMMA surface; time of exposure 70-100 h, room temperature). 
      The UV irradiated samples were stored in the atmosphere of N2 under the 
      heating-protected and clean conditions. The IOL sample holder allowed to remove 
      IOL loops and their fixation areas from the zone of the passing light. The 
      absorptive properties of IOLs treated with UV light were similar to those of 
      young human lenses. Raman vibration and fluorescence spectral analyses of IOLs 
      have shown that the yellow colour and its intensity in the irradiated samples 
      depends on the presence of conjugated C = C and C = O groups (pi-pi conjugation) 
      in the chemical composition of PMMA. When the PMMA samples were exposed for 70 h 
      to a high level of UV radiation (50-100 W/sq m) no damage was seen with scanning 
      electron microscopy at both side surfaces of the IOLs. The PMMA water exhaustive 
      extracts made by 70 h of UV radiation exposure did not show any cytological 
      damage when injected into the cell cultures of fibroblasts. The threshold for 
      optical breakdown in PMMA was detected by 100 h of UV radiation at the level of 
      exposure equivalent to at least 20,000 times levels for expected ambient UV 
      exposure to PMMA within the eye. A rigorous quality index defined as the ratio of 
      the line C = C/C = O stretching mode intensities was introduced for the 
      UV-absorbing PMMA photostability. The findings suggest an applicability of the 
      photochemical tinting and further research to test the efficacy and safety of 
      UV-absorbing chromophore induction in the PMMA IOLs.

TI  - Effect of light filters on reading speed in normal and low vision due to 
      age-related macular degeneration.
PG  - 17-25
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of light filters on reading speed in normal 
      and low vision due to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). METHODS: Reading 
      speed was determined for 12 subjects with normal vision and 12 subjects with 
      non-exudative AMD using stationary lowercase nonsensical print in Times Roman 
      font and four light filters; a yellow Corning Photochromic Filter (CPF) 450, a 
      grey neural density (ND) filter, an individual filter obtained using the 
      Intuitive Colorimeter and a clear filter. RESULTS: There was no statistically 
      significant light filter effect on reading speed for the normal subjects. The AMD 
      group demonstrated a statistically significant 5% average improvement in reading 
      speed with the CPF450 compared with the other filters although some AMD subjects 
      had improvements of 10-15%. CONCLUSIONS: Light filters obtained using the 
      Intuitive Colorimeter(R) performed poorly when compared with the CPF450, ND and 
      clear filters for both the study groups. For the AMD group, average reading speed 
      was statistically greater with the CPF450 than the other filters, however it is 
      questionable whether the improvement (5%) would be clinically significant. As 
      some of the subjects with AMD had greater improvements with the CPF450 we 
      advocate clinical assessment of light filters using existing protocols on an 
      individual basis.

TI  - Effect of blue light-filtering intraocular lens on color vision in patients with 
      macular diseases after vitrectomy.
PG  - 829-839
AB  - To evaluate the color vision of patients with macular diseases after implanting a 
      blue light-filtering intraocular lens (IOL) during vitrectomy. Twenty-seven 
      patients had a blue light-filtering IOL implanted during vitrectomy for macular 
      diseases (macular disease group), and 40 patients without macular disease had the 
      same type of IOL implanted (non-macular disease group). The postoperative 
      best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was ≥ 16/20 in all patients. The 
      Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test was used to determine total error scores (TES) 
      and mean error scores under photopic and mesopic conditions in both groups. The 
      TES under mesopic conditions was significantly higher than that under photopic 
      conditions in both groups (P < 0.05). However, the TES in the macular disease 
      group was not significantly different from that of the non-macular disease group 
      under both photopic and mesopic conditions. The mean error scores under photopic 
      conditions for hues 11, 14, 16, 17, 18, and 20 (yellowish-red to yellow) were 
      significantly higher in the macular disease group than in the non-macular disease 
      group. The mean error scores for hues 7 and 85 (red) were significantly higher in 
      the non-macular disease group than in the macular disease group. Under mesopic 
      conditions, the mean error scores for hues 30, 60, and 61 were significantly 
      higher in the non-macular disease group than in the macular disease group 
      (P < 0.05). Our results indicate that blue light-filtering IOLs do not alter 
      color discrimination in eyes with macular diseases, and these patients had good 
      postoperative BCVA even under mesopic conditions.

      affective disorder and healthy controls.
PG  - 227-31
LID - 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2010.11.009 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is characterized by a mood lowering 
      in autumn and/or winter followed by spontaneous remission in spring or summer. 
      Bright light (BL) is recognized as the treatment of choice for individuals 
      affected with this disease. It was speculated that BL acts on photosensitive 
      retinal ganglion cells, particularly sensitive to blue light, which led to the 
      emergence of apparatus enriched with blue light. However, blue light is more at 
      risk to cause retinal damage. In addition, we reported using electroretinography 
      (ERG) that a 60 min exposure of BL could reduce rod sensitivity. The goal of the 
      present study was to verify if this decreased in sensitivity could be a 
      consequence of the blue light portion present in the white light therapy lamps. 
      We also wanted to assess the effect of monochromatic blue light vs red light in 
      both healthy controls and patients with SAD. METHOD: 10 healthy subjects and 10 
      patients with SAD were exposed in a random order for 60 min to two different 
      light colors (red or blue) separated by an interval of at least 1 day. Cone and 
      rod ERG luminance-response function was assessed after light exposure. RESULTS: A 
      two-way ANOVA indicates that blue light decreases the maximal ERG response (Vmax) 
      in both groups in photopic (p<0.05) and scotopic conditions (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: 
      The main finding of this experiment is that blue light reduces photoreceptor 
      responses after only a single administration. This brings important concerns with 
      regard to blue-enriched light therapy lamps used to treat SAD symptoms and other 
      disorders.

TI  - Genetic dissection of blue-light sensing in tomato using mutants deficient in 
      cryptochrome 1 and phytochromes A, B1 and B2.
PG  - 427-40
AB  - Several novel allelic groups of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) mutants with 
      impaired photomorphogenesis have been identified after gamma-ray mutagenesis of 
      phyA phyB1 double-mutant seed. Recessive mutants in one allelic group are 
      characterized by retarded hook opening, increased hypocotyl elongation and 
      reduced hypocotyl chlorophyll content under white light (WL). These mutants 
      showed a specific impairment in response to blue light (BL) resulting from 
      lesions in the gene encoding the BL receptor cryptochrome 1 (cry1). Phytochrome A 
      and cry1 are identified as the major photoreceptors mediating BL-induced 
      de-etiolation in tomato, and act under low and high irradiances, respectively. 
      Phytochromes B1 and B2 also contribute to BL sensing, and the relative 
      contribution of each of these four photoreceptors differs according to the light 
      conditions and the specific process examined. Development of the phyA phyB1 phyB2 
      cry1 quadruple mutant under WL is severely impaired, and seedlings die before 
      flowering. The quadruple mutant is essentially blind to BL, but experiments 
      employing simultaneous irradiation with BL and red light suggest that an 
      additional non-phytochrome photoreceptor may be active under short daily BL 
      exposures. In addition to effects on de-etiolation, cry1 is active in older, 
      WL-grown plants, and influences stem elongation, apical dominance, and the 
      chlorophyll content of leaves and fruit. These results provide the first 
      mutant-based characterization of cry1 in a plant species other than Arabidopsis.

TI  - The effect of blue-blocking and neutral intraocular lenses on circadian 
      photoentrainment and sleep one year after cataract surgery.
PG  - 344-351
LID - 10.1111/aos.13323 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the long-term effect on circadian photoentrainment and sleep 
      in patients implanted with neutral and blue-blocking intraocular lenses 1 year 
      after cataract surgery. METHODS: Randomized, controlled trial involving 67 
      patients with age-related cataract. Intervention was cataract surgery with 
      implantation of either a neutral or a blue-blocking intraocular lens (IOL). Main 
      outcome was activation of the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells 
      (ipRGC) measured by chromatic pupillometry. The circadian rhythm was analysed by 
      24-hr melatonin profiles and actigraphy; the latter was also used to determine 
      objective sleep quality. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index determined subjective 
      sleep quality. RESULTS: One year after surgery, peak melatonin concentration was 
      3.3 pg/ml (95% CI, 2-5.5) corresponding to 50% lower for the participants 
      allocated to blue-blocking IOLs compared with participants allocated to neutral 
      IOLs. Compared with preoperative levels, the ipRGC response had increased by 
      13.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.2-22.6) 1 year after surgery. Objective 
      sleep quality was also improved as the time of wakefulness after sleep onset had 
      improved by 5 min (95% CI, 1-10) for the entire population while sleep efficiency 
      had increased by two percentage points (95% CI, 0.42-3.65) although exclusively, 
      for the participants allocated to blue-blocking IOLs. CONCLUSION: Blue-blocking 
      IOLs increased sleep efficiency but lowered nocturnal melatonin secretion 
      compared with neutral IOLs. Cataract surgery improved the response of ipRGCs and 
      sleep quality. However, the effect of cataract surgery on sleep quality may be 
      unrelated to circadian photoentrainment.

TI  - Age-related maculopathy and the impact of blue light hazard.
PG  - 4-15
AB  - The pathogenesis of age-related maculopathy (ARM), the most common cause of 
      visual loss after the age of 60 years, is indeed a complicated scenario that 
      involves a variety of hereditary and environmental factors. The pathological 
      cellular and molecular events underlying retinal photochemical light damage, 
      including photoreceptor apoptosis, have been analysed in experimental animal 
      models. Studies of age-related alterations of the retina and photoreceptors, the 
      accumulation of lipofuscin in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, and the 
      formation of drusen have greatly contributed to our knowledge. A new concept of 
      an inflammatory response to drusen has emerged, suggesting immunogenic and 
      systemic reactions in Bruch's membrane and the subretinal space. Oxidative stress 
      and free radical damage also impact on the photoreceptors and RPE cells in the 
      ageing eye. Based on the photoelectric effect, a fundamental concept in quantum 
      physics, the consequences of high-energy irradiation have been analysed in animal 
      models and cell culture. Short-wavelength radiation (rhodopsin spectrum), and the 
      blue light hazard (excitation peak 440 nm), have been shown to have a major 
      impact on photoreceptor and RPE function, inducing photochemical damage and 
      apoptotic cell death. Following cataract surgery, there is a dramatic change in 
      ocular transmittance. In aphakic or pseudophakic eyes (with clear intraocular 
      lenses), high-energy (blue) and ultraviolet-A radiation strikes the retina. 
      Epidemiological data indicate a significantly increased 5-year incidence of late 
      ARM in non-phakic eyes compared with phakic eyes. In recent years, putative 
      prophylactic measures against ARM have emerged. The implantation of 'yellow' 
      intraocular lenses (IOLs) that absorb high-energy blue radiation is, from a 
      theoretical point of view, the most rational approach, and, from a practical 
      point of view, is easy to accomplish. With increasing age, RPE cells accumulate 
      lipofuscin (chromophore A2E). It is noteworthy that the yellow IOL not only 
      protects A2E-laden human RPE cells from blue light (peak 430 nm) damage, but also 
      alleviates the detrimental effects of green (peak 550 nm) and white light. A 
      prophylactic treatment using antioxidants is aimed at counteracting oxidative 
      stress and free radical cellular damage. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study 
      (AREDS), a randomized clinical trial, showed a significantly lower incidence of 
      late ARM in a cohort of patients with drusen maculopathy treated with high doses 
      of antioxidants than in a placebo group. In recent years, considerable progress 
      in retinal research has been achieved, creating a platform for the search for new 
      prophylactic and therapeutic measures to alleviate or prevent photoreceptor and 
      RPE degeneration in ARM.

      monocentric case series including 98 consecutive naive neovascular age-related 
      macular degeneration patients. Presence of RPD was assessed by two graders based 
      on color, blue-light, fundus autofluorescence pictures, and spectral-domain 
      optical coherence tomography. A correlation between the presence of RPD and the 
      visual change was investigated. Other baseline characteristics studied in a 
      monovariate and multivariate analysis were the following: age, gender, affected 
      side, loading dose, type of neovascularization, presence of retinal pigment 
      epithelial detachment >250 μm, subretinal or intraretinal fluid, blood over >50% 
      of the lesion, and subfoveal choroidal thickness. RESULTS: The presence of RPD 
      was not associated with a visual change (P = 0.96), but with a thin subfoveal 
      choroidal thickness at baseline (P < 0.0001). The monovariate analysis showed 
      that the presence of blood at baseline was associated with visual gain (P = 
      0.007). CONCLUSION: The presence of RPD at baseline was not identified as a 
      factor associated with a poor 1-year response to ranibizumab in eyes with 
      neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Studies with a longer follow-up may 
      be needed to assess the impact of RPD on the visual prognosis of eyes with 
      neovascular age-related macular degeneration.

LID - e0141238
AB  - Opn3/TMT opsins belong to one of the opsin groups with vertebrate visual and 
      non-visual opsins, and are widely distributed in eyes, brains and other internal 
      organs in various vertebrates and invertebrates. Vertebrate Opn3/TMT opsins are 
      further classified into four groups on the basis of their amino acid identities. 
      However, there is limited information about molecular properties of these groups, 
      due to the difficulty in preparing the recombinant proteins. Here, we 
      successfully expressed recombinant proteins of TMT1 and TMT2 opsins of medaka 
      fish (Oryzias latipes) in cultured cells and characterized their molecular 
      properties. Spectroscopic and biochemical studies demonstrated that TMT1 and TMT2 
      opsins functioned as blue light-sensitive Gi/Go-coupled receptors, but exhibited 
      spectral properties and photo-convertibility of the active state different from 
      each other. TMT1 opsin forms a visible light-absorbing active state containing 
      all-trans-retinal, which can be photo-converted to 7-cis- and 9-cis-retinal 
      states in addition to the original 11-cis-retinal state. In contrast, the active 
      state of TMT2 opsin is a UV light-absorbing state having all-trans-retinal and 
      does not photo-convert to any other state, including the original 11-cis-retinal 
      state. Thus, TMT opsins are diversified so as to form a different type of active 
      state, which may be responsible for their different functions.

      lenses.
PG  - 274-8
LID - 10.3129/i08-121 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study compares the visual performance of spherical and aspherical 
      intraocular lenses (IOLs) by measuring higher-order aberration and contrast 
      sensitivity (CS) values. DESIGN: Prospective controlled study. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Fifty-seven patients with age-related cataract (61 eyes). METHODS: Patients were 
      randomly allocated to 1 of 3 groups and implanted with either aspherical IOLs, 
      Acrysof IQ (SN60WF) or Tecnis Z9001, or a spherical IOL, Acrysof Natural. 
      Patients underwent routine examinations, including visual acuity, slit-lamp 
      checks, and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), as well as measurement of 
      higher-order aberrations and CS values, preoperatively and at 1 week, 1 month, 
      and 2 months postoperatively. RESULTS: All the patients had a BCVA better than 
      20/30 postoperatively. The spherical aberrations of the IQ group and Tecnis group 
      were both lower than in the Natural (control) group (IQ: p < 0.05; Tecnis: p < 
      0.05); there was no significant difference in coma and higher-order aberration. 
      No statistically significant difference was found in spherical aberration, coma, 
      or higher-order aberration between the IQ and Tecnis groups. Under glare 
      conditions, the CS values of the 2 aspherical IOLs were obviously better (IQ: p < 
      0.05; Tecnis: p < 0.05) than the CS value of the spherical IOL group at low 
      frequency (IQ: 6.3 degrees, Tecnis: 4.0 degrees); under non-glare conditions 
      there was a significant difference in CS values between the aspherical IOL groups 
      and the control group (IQ: p < 0.01; Tecnis: p < 0.01) at low frequency (both 6.3 
      degrees). There was no statistical difference between the IQ and the Tecnis 
      groups with or without glare. CONCLUSIONS: An aspherical IOL can effectively 
      reduce spherical aberration after cataract surgery, enhance CS values, and 
      improve visual quality compared with traditional spherical IOLs for age-related 
      cataract. However, there was no statistically significant difference in 
      postoperative aberration and CS values between the Acrysof IQ and Tecnis Z9001 
      aspherical IOLs.

TI  - Early changes in gene expression induced by blue light irradiation of A2E-laden 
      retinal pigment epithelial cells.
PG  - e537-45
LID - 10.1111/aos.12146 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Accumulation of bisretinoids as lipofuscin in retinal pigment epithelial 
      (RPE) cells is implicated in the pathogenesis of some blinding diseases including 
      age-related macular degeneration (AMD). To identify genes whose expression may 
      change under conditions of bisretinoid accumulation, we investigated the 
      differential gene expression in RPE cells that had accumulated the lipofuscin 
      fluorophore A2E and were exposed to blue light (430 nm). METHODS: A2E-laden RPE 
      cells were exposed to blue light (A2E/430 nm) at various time intervals. Cell 
      death was quantified using Dead Red staining, and RNA levels for the entire 
      genome was determined using DNA microarrays (Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome 2.0 
      Plus). Array results for selected genes were confirmed by real-time 
      reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Principal component 
      analysis revealed that the A2E-laden RPE cells irradiated with blue light were 
      clearly distinguishable from the control samples. We found differential 
      regulation of genes belonging to the following functional groups: transcription 
      factors, stress response, apoptosis and immune response. Among the last mentioned 
      were downregulation of four genes that coded for proteins that have an inhibitory 
      effect on the complement cascade: (complement factor H, complement factor 
      H-related 1, complement factor I and vitronectin) and of two belonging to the 
      classical pathway (complement component 1, s subcomponent and complement 
      component 1, r subcomponent). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that blue light 
      irradiation of A2E-laden RPE cells can alter the transcription of genes belonging 
      to different functional pathways including stress response, apoptosis and the 
      immune response. We suggest that these molecules may be associated to the 
      pathogenesis of AMD and can potentially serve as future therapeutic targets.

TI  - Contrast sensitivity and glare disability after implantation of AcrySof IQ 
      Natural aspherical intraocular lens: prospective randomized masked clinical 
      trial.
PG  - 603-10
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate contrast sensitivity and glare disability after implantation 
      of an AcrySof IQ Natural SN60WF aspherical intraocular lens (IOL) (Alcon 
      Laboratories). SETTING: Iladevi Cataract & IOL Research Centre, Ahmedabad, India. 
      METHODS: One hundred twenty consecutive patients who had phacoemulsification in a 
      prospective triple-masked trial were randomized to receive an AcrySof SA60AT IOL 
      (40 eyes), AcrySof Natural SN60AT IOL (40 eyes), or AcrySof IQ SN60WF IOL (40 
      eyes). At 3 months, contrast sensitivity was measured using the CSV-1000E 
      contrast sensitivity chart test face (Vector Vision) at 3, 6, 12, and 18 cycles 
      per degrees (cpd) under photopic conditions (85 cd/m(2)) and mesopic conditions 
      (2.7 cd/m(2)) with 4.0 mm and 6.0 mm fixed central apertures, with and without 
      glare. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used and a pair-wise comparison performed. The 
      main outcome measure was the difference in contrast sensitivity between IOLs at 
      each spatial frequency. RESULTS: The best corrected visual acuity was similar 
      between the 3 IOL groups (P = .6). The AcrySof IQ group had significantly higher 
      contrast sensitivity at 18 cpd under photopic conditions (P = .008); at 3, 6, 12, 
      and 18 cpd during mesopic testing with a 4.0 mm aperture without glare (P = .018, 
      P = .011, P = .007, and P = .0001, respectively) and with glare (P = .003, P = 
      .006, P = .005, and P = .004, respectively); and at all spatial frequencies 
      during mesopic testing with a 6.0 mm aperture without glare (P = .018, P = .006, 
      P = .009, and P = .0001, respectively) and with glare (P = .019, P = .002, P = 
      .01, and P = .017, respectively). CONCLUSION: Eyes with the AcrySof IQ SN60WF IOL 
      had significantly higher contrast sensitivity than eyes with an AcrySof SA60AT or 
      AcrySof Natural SN60AT IOL at all spatial frequencies during mesopic testing 
      (with and without glare) with 4.0 and 6.0 mm artificial pupil.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of warm ophthalmic viscosurgical devices (OVDs) 
      on the unfolding time of prehydrated hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lenses 
      (IOLs). DESIGN: Experimental study and human trial. PARTICIPANTS: Three foldable 
      hydrophobic acrylic IOLs (enVista MX60, AcrySof SN60AT, and Tecnis 1 ZCB00). 
      METHODS: The unfolding times of 3 kinds of IOLs were measured according to 
      temperature from 26°C to 32°C in a transparent container filled with a mixture of 
      OVDs and balanced salt solution. The unfolding time of each IOL was measured 4 
      times for each temperature. Unfolding time was defined as the time required for 
      the folded IOL to recover ≥ 90% of its overall optic diameter before folding. In 
      human trials, the unfolding time of the MX60 in a capsular bag filled with 30°C 
      OVDs was compared with that filled with room temperature OVDs for 4 cases in each 
      group. RESULTS: The unfolding time of the MX60 (215 ± 25 seconds) was 
      significantly longer than that of the SN60AT (28 ± 7 seconds) and the ZCB00 (29 ± 
      7 seconds) at 26°C (p = 0.013). However, there were no differences in the 
      unfolding time of 3 IOLs at 32°C. In human trials, the unfolding time of the MX60 
      was shorter in a capsular bag filled with 30°C OVDs (32 ± 13 seconds) than if 
      filled with OVDs kept at room temperature (127 ± 27 seconds; p = 0.029). 
      CONCLUSIONS: When fast and complete unfolding characteristics are needed, filling 
      the anterior chamber and capsular bag with OVDs warmed to 30°C before IOL 
      implantation is recommended.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report the use of trypan blue staining of the filtering bleb to 
      assess its functional status in eyes undergoing phacoemulsification after 
      trabeculectomy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at a 
      tertiary eye care centre in North India and studied 33 eyes of 33 patients ( with 
      previously operated trabeculectomy), who underwent phacoemulsification. Trypan 
      blue dye (0.06%) was used to stain the anterior capsule. After completion of 
      phacoemulsification, the staining of the trabeculectomy bleb was noted as 
      diffuse, patchy, minimal or no staining. RESULTS: Of the 33 eyes, 13 had diffuse 
      staining (39.4%, mean IOP = 9.3 ± 2.2 mm Hg), 7 (21.2%, mean IOP= 15.5 ± 1.8 mm 
      Hg) had patchy staining, 4 had minimal staining (12.1%, mean IOP= 17.5 ± 0.5mm 
      Hg) and nine (27.3%, mean IOP= 19.3 ± 1.6 mm Hg) had no staining. These staining 
      patterns were labeled as groups 1 - 4 respectively. Statistical analysis showed 
      that the difference between the IOPs in Group 1 - 2 and between Group 2 - 3 was 
      not significant statistically (p=0.682 and 0.665 respectively). However the 
      differences between the IOPs between Groups 1 - 3, 1 - 4, 2 - 4, and 3 - 4 were 
      found to be highly significant statistically (p less than 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Trypan blue dye can be used to test the amount of sub conjunctival filtration in 
      eyes undergoing phacoemulsification cataract surgery.

TI  - Iris pigmentation and extent of disease in patients with neovascular age-related 
      macular degeneration.
PG  - 2734-40
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether the extent of disease in age-related macular 
      degeneration (AMD) varies with iris pigmentation. METHODS: The authors assessed 
      visual function and macular appearance in the fellow eye or both eyes of 132 
      white patients with unilateral neovascular AMD. All patients had a visual acuity 
      of 20/60 or better in the fellow eye. Eighty-nine of the patients were coded as 
      having light irides (blue, green, or hazel) and 43 were coded as having dark 
      irides (brown); the two groups of patients had comparable mean ages. RESULTS: By 
      the Mann-Whitney test for differences in mean rank, fellow eyes with light irides 
      showed a marginally worse visual acuity (P = .156) but significantly more visual 
      field impairment by letter recognition perimetry (P = .011) and the macular 
      threshold test of the Humphrey Field Analyzer (P = .043), and more retinal 
      pigment epithelial atrophy (P = .017) and focal areas of hyperpigmentation (P = 
      .002) than fellow eyes with dark irides. For eyes with a choroidal neovascular 
      membrane (CNVM), those with light irides had significantly lower visual acuities 
      (P = .006) and larger scars (P = .006) than eyes with dark irides. In addition, 
      extent of disease in the eye with a CNVM was positively correlated with extent of 
      disease in the fellow eye for most comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: These observations 
      suggest that light iris pigmentation is associated with more extensive retinal 
      disease in patients with unilateral neovascular AMD. Furthermore, in such 
      patients, those with worse disease in the eye with a CNVM may tend to have more 
      extensive atrophic disease in the fellow eye.

      damage in rats.
PG  - 151-7

AB  - AIM: To explore the effect of saturated hydrogen saline on blue light-induced 
      retinal damage in rats. METHODS: The retinal damage of rats was induced by blue 
      light exposure for 6 hours and examined 8 hours, 16 hours and 24 hours after the 
      exposure. One hundred female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four 
      groups. Group 1 included 30 rats received light exposure without any other 
      treatment. Group 2 included 30 rats received light exposure with intraperitoneal 
      injection of normal saline. Group 3 included 30 rats received light exposure with 
      intraperitoneal injection of saturated hydrogen saline. And Group 4 included the 
      other 10 rats which did not receive any treatment. The amount of intraperitoneal 
      injection of saturated hydrogen saline and normal saline was calculated in the 
      ratio of 1ml/100g of rat weight. Specimens were collected and processed by H-E 
      staining, ultrastructure observation, biochemical measurement. Morphological 
      changes were observed by light microscope and transmission electron microscope 
      (TEM) and the retinal outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness was measured by IPP 
      6.0, while the malondialdehyde (MDA) was measured by colorimetric determination 
      at 532 nm. RESULTS: Although the structure of retina in Group 1 and Group 2 was 
      injured heavily, the injury in Group 3 was mild. The differences between Group 1 
      and Group 2 were not significant. Compared with the rats in Group 1 and Group 2, 
      the ones in Group 3 had more clearly demarcated retina structure and more ordered 
      cells by light microscope and TEM observation. The ONL thicknesses (400 times) of 
      four groups at each time point except between Group 1 and Group 2 were 
      significantly different (P<0.05). The thicknesses of the ONL in Group 1 at three 
      time points were 30.41±4.04µm, 26.11±2.82µm and 20.63±1.06µm, in Group 2 were 
      31.62±4.54µm, 25.08±3.63µm and 19.07±3.86µm, in Group 3 were 29.75±3.62µm, 
      28.83±1.97µm and 27.61±1.83µm. In Group 4 the mean of the thickness was 
      37.35±1.37µm. As time went by, the damage grew more severely. At 24h point, the 
      differences were most significant. Compared with Group 4, the thickness was 
      46.23% thinner in Group 1, 50.29% thinner in Group 2 and 28.04% thinner in Group 
      3. The stack structures of membranous disc in Group 3 were injured slightly, but 
      in Group 1 and Group 2 the damage was more obvious by TEM. Compared with Group 4 
      at each time point, the content of MDA in Group 1 was higher (P<0.05). The 
      content of MDA in Group 3 was significantly lower than those of Group 1 (P<0.05) 
      and Group 2 (P<0.05). Between the Group 1 and Group 2, the MDA concentration at 
      each time point was no significant difference (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Saturated 
      hydrogen saline could protect the retina from light-induced damage by attenuating 
      oxidative stress.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate contrast sensitivity and color vision of yellow 
      ultraviolet (UV) intraocular len (IOL) in cataract patients. DESIGN: Randomized 
      clinical trial. METHODS: Extracapsular cataract extraction was performed in 60 
      senile cataract patients. The patients were randomly assigned to receive 30 
      yellow UV IOLs and 30 ordinary UV IOLs. Visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and 
      color vision were examined up to 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS: The yellow UV 
      IOLs showed statistically significantly higher spatial contrast sensitivity than 
      ordinary UV IOLs in the low and middle frequencies. There was no significant 
      difference between yellow and ordinary UV IOL in color vision. Incidences of 
      photophobia and cyanopsia were less in patients who received the yellow UV IOLs. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Yellow UV IOLs are preferable to ordinary UV IOLs in preserving 
      spatial contrast sensitivity and cause less photophobia and cyanopsia in the 
      early postoperative period.

TI  - shl, a New set of Arabidopsis mutants with exaggerated developmental responses to 
      available red, far-red, and blue light.
PG  - 295-304
AB  - The interaction of light perception with development is the subject of intensive 
      genetic analysis in the model plant Arabidopsis. We performed genetic screens in 
      low white light-a threshold condition in which photomorphogenetic signaling 
      pathways are only partially active-for ethyl methane sulfonate-generated mutants 
      with altered developmental phenotypes. Recessive mutants with exaggerated 
      developmental responses were obtained in eight complementation groups designated 
      shl for seedlings hyperresponsive to light. shl1, shl2, shl5, and shl3 shl4 
      (double mutant) seedlings showed limited or no phenotypic effects in darkness, 
      but showed significantly enhanced inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in 
      low-white, red, far-red, blue, and green light across a range of fluences. These 
      results reflect developmental hyper-responsiveness to signals generated by both 
      phytochrome and cryptochrome photoreceptors. The shl11 mutant retained 
      significant phenotypic effects on hypocotyl length in both the phyA mutant and 
      phyB mutant backgrounds but may be dependent on CRY1 for phenotypic expression in 
      blue light. The shl2 phenotype was partially dependent on PHYB, PHYA, and CRY1 in 
      red, far-red, and blue light, respectively. shl2 and, in particular, shl1 were 
      partially dependent on HY5 activity for their light-hyperresponsive phenotypes. 
      The SHL genes act (genetically) as light-dependent negative regulators of 
      photomorphogenesis, possibly in a downstream signaling or developmental pathway 
      that is shared by CRY1, PHYA, and PHYB and other photoreceptors (CRY2, PHYC, 
      PHYD, and PHYE).

TI  - Clinical evaluation of the use of indocyanine green for peeling the internal 
      limiting membrane in macular hole surgery.
PG  - 291-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the role of indocyanine green (infracyanine) in macular 
      hole surgery. METHODS: A retrospective review of 38 consecutive eyes with macular 
      hole, operated on with internal limiting membrane peeling (ILM), using or not 
      using infracyanine (ICG), diluted in glucose 5% and filtered. Anatomical and 
      functional results were analysed in each group, using visual field testing, 
      fluorescein fundus angiography and particularly blue filter fundus photographs 
      for the detection of retinal pigment epithelial changes and lesions of optic 
      nerve fibres layer. RESULTS: Fifteen eyes underwent surgery without ICG and 23 
      eyes with ICG. The mean period of follow-up was 10 months. The duration of 
      surgery was significantly lower in the group with ICG than without (P < 0.001). 
      Overall, 84% of the holes closed without difference between both groups. The 
      improvement in vision at 1, 6 and 12 months was similar in both groups. Fewer 
      defects in the optic nerve fibres layer were observed in the group with ICG than 
      without (P = 0.02). Staining with ICG revealed the presence of an associated 
      epiretinal membrane in 61% of eyes, whereas it was clinically visible in only 
      17.5% before surgery. CONCLUSION: Using ICG for ILM peeling produced similar 
      visual results to those obtained without ICG. It reduced significantly the 
      duration of surgery and the trauma to the optic nerve fibres layer, without 
      increasing the risk of retinal pigment epithelial damage. However, in the light 
      of recent reports about the possible toxicity of ICG, its use should be 
      restricted in clinical practice to difficult cases.

TI  - [Influence of cutoff filters on reading behavior in age-related macular 
      degeneration].
PG  - 692-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cutoff filters may improve contrast sensitivity in different retinal 
      dystrophies and therefore lead to improved visual function. We investigated 
      whether cutoff filters result in improved reading ability in age-related macular 
      degeneration (AMD). METHODS: Reading performance was examined in 22 patients with 
      AMD aged 63-91 years (visual acuity 0.1-0.5) using the Radner reading charts. 
      These charts were presented in random order either with or without cutoff filters 
      (Zeiss CF 540 and CF 580) monocularly to the better eye using a defined luminance 
      of the test charts of 105 cd/m(2). RESULTS: Using the CF 540 cutoff filter, there 
      was no significant change in visual acuity while there was a tendency to 
      decrease. Calculating the LogRAD score, which takes reading errors into account, 
      three patients improved by one line, while nine deteriorated, six of them by one 
      line or more. There was no significant improvement using the CF 580 compared to 
      either the CF 540 or to normal reading glasses. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found no 
      measurable improvement using the CF 540 cutoff filter. The cutoff filter CF 580, 
      tested for additional comparison, did not show any advantage.

TI  - Anti-apoptotic effects of Curcuma longa L. extract and its curcuminoids against 
      blue light-induced cytotoxicity in A2E-laden human retinal pigment epithelial 
      cells.
PG  - 334-340
LID - 10.1111/jphp.12691 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to investigate the protective effect of 
      the Curcuma longa L. extract (CLE) and its curcuminoids against blue 
      light-induced cytotoxicity in human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells laded 
      with A2E. A2E has been concerned in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). 
      METHODS: To perform this study, A2E-accumulated ARPE-19 cells were exposed to 
      blue light to induce cytotoxicity. The cytotoxicity and apoptotic gene expression 
      levels were evaluated using a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay and real-time PCR 
      analysis, respectively. KEY FINDINGS: Curcuma longa L. extract was found to exert 
      a protective effect in a dose-dependent manner. At a concentration of 15 μm, 
      curcumin, demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin exerted significant 
      protective effects against blue light-induced cytotoxicity. Treatment with CLE 
      and curcuminoids meaningfully reduced the mRNA levels of c-Abl and p53, which was 
      known to be augmented in apoptotic RPE cells. Demethoxycurcumin and 
      bisdemethoxycurcumin were found to inhibit p38 expression, which is increased in 
      blue light-irradiated A2E-accumulated RPE cells. CONCLUSIONS: Curcuma longa L. 
      extract and its curcuminoids provided significant protection against 
      photooxidative damage and apoptosis in the RPE cells. Our results suggest that 
      curcuminoids may show potential in the treatment of AMD.

TI  - Antidepressant medication reverses increased sensitivity to light in depression: 
      preliminary report.
PG  - 537-41
AB  - 1. Sensitivity to blue light was quantified using a Friedman Central Field 
      Analyzer and the Dark Adaptation Threshold procedure. 2. Patients diagnosed as 
      having a major depressive disorder using research diagnostic criteria had dark 
      adaptation thresholds quantified after a 10 day drug wash out and again after 
      antidepressant drug therapy. 3. Prior to drug treatment patients were 
      significantly more sensitive to light than controls as measured by cone but not 
      rod thresholds. 4. Following drug treatment both cone and rod thresholds were 
      reduced in patients. In comparison to controls, drug treatment normalized cone 
      threshold and reduced rod threshold in patients. 5. These data provide 
      ophthalmological evidence for increased sensitivity to light in non medicated 
      depressive disorder and a reduction in sensitivity following antidepressant drug 
      therapy. 6. The possibility of altered retinal function and consequently the 
      ability to perceive and use light for entrainment of circadian rhythm in 
      affective disorder deserves further study.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the effect of intraocular lens (IOL) asphericity on quality 
      of vision after cataract removal. DESIGN: Intraindividual, prospective, 
      randomized clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-six cataract patients received 2, 
      one-piece, blue-light-filtering hydrophobic acrylic IOLs each. METHODS: One eye 
      was implanted with a spherical (SN60AT, Alcon) and the contralateral eye with an 
      aspheric (SN60WF, Alcon) IOL with -0.2 mum spherical aberration (SA). All 
      trial-specific measurements (corneal topography, wavefront sensing, high-contrast 
      visual acuity [HCVA], contrast sensitivity [CS]) were performed 6 months after 
      surgery. A paired Student t-test or Wilcoxon test was used to check intergroup 
      differences. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Absolute values and intraindividual 
      differences (Delta(i)) of corneal and ocular higher order aberrations and 
      best-corrected visual Strehl ratio based on the optical transfer function 
      (BCVSOTF) values for virtual pupil diameters of 3, 4, 5, and 6 mm were computed. 
      Photopic and mesopic HCVA, photopic, and high-mesopic CS as well as high-mesopic 
      disability glare (DG) were measured using the Frankfurt-Freiburg Contrast and 
      Acuity Test System. RESULTS: No intergroup difference of demographic data, 
      pupillometry, and corneal aberrations were observed. Coma and trefoil root mean 
      square and SA were significantly lower in the aspheric group resulting in higher 
      BCVSOTF, mesopic HCVA, and photopic and high mesopic CS. All Delta(i) values with 
      exception of photopic HCVA and DG indicated significantly better performance of 
      the aspheric IOL. CONCLUSIONS: An aspheric IOL with -0.2 microm SA provide higher 
      quality of vision than spherical IOL in terms of retinal image quality, mesopic 
      HCVA and CS. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): Proprietary or commercial disclosures may 
      be found after the references.

TI  - The Relation Between Light-Induced Lacrimation and the Melanopsin-Driven 
      Postillumination Pupil Response.
PG  - 1449-1454
LID - 10.1167/iovs.16-21285 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the chromatic characteristics and intensity-response 
      function of light-induced reflex lacrimation and its correlation with the 
      melanopsin-driven postillumination pupil response (PIPR). METHODS: Eleven 
      visually normal participants completed the experiment. Lacrimation was measured 
      in one eye by placing a calibrated filter paper strip in the conjunctival sac 
      over a 1 minute-interval (Schirmer's test) during which participants received 
      either no light stimulation (baseline trial) or one flash of blue or red light 
      stimuli presented binocularly with a Ganzfeld stimulator, while the pupil 
      response was recorded simultaneously from the fellow eye by using an eye tracker. 
      Light stimulation trials were presented in alternating fashion at seven 
      incremental intensity steps (0.1, 1, 3.16, 10, 31.6, 100, and 400 cd/m2). 
      Postillumination pupil response was defined as the mean pupil constriction from 
      10 to 30 seconds post illumination. RESULTS: The amount of lacrimation in 
      response to 10 to 400 cd/m2 blue light was significantly greater than baseline 
      and increased monotonically with increasing light intensity. Red light did not 
      induce significant reflex lacrimation until the brightest stimulation at 400 
      cd/m2. There was a positive linear correlation between PIPR and lacrimation in 
      response to blue light (r = 0.74, P < 0.001) but not to red light (r = 0.13, P = 
      0.25). CONCLUSIONS: The chromatic characteristics and intensity-response of 
      light-induced lacrimation are highly consistent with the features of melanopsin 
      phototransduction. This finding is the first in vivo evidence in humans, 
      supporting the hypothesis that light-induced reflex lacrimation is mediated 
      primarily by melanopsin photoactivity, and provides new insight into the putative 
      mechanisms of photophobia.

TI  - Acetazolamide affects performance on the Nagel II anomaloscope.
PG  - S193-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent reports have indicated that acetazolamide alters human 
      electroretinograms. We wished to determine the effects of administering 
      acetazolamide on performance on the Nagel II anomaloscope. METHODS: We tested 15 
      subjects matches of blue-green light to a mixture of blue and green lights 
      (luminance match) on a Nagel type II anomaloscope 2.5 h after ingesting 500 mg of 
      acetazolamide or a placebo. RESULTS: The mean of the luminance settings for the 
      subjects was 54.4 for the placebo condition and 58.5 for the acetazolamide 
      condition. The mean difference of 4.1 was statistically significant, indicating 
      that following ingestion of acetazolamide subjects were less sensitive to a 
      blue-green light. In two supplementary experiments we tested (1) a second group 
      of four normal subjects using the Nagel type II anomaloscope and (2) the 
      previously untreated eyes of four patients with primary open-angle glaucoma 
      before and after placing them on acetazolamide therapy. In both groups, more 
      blue-green light was needed to make the match after ingestion of acetazolamide. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Acetazolamide alters the sensitivity of one or more cone 
      populations, probably the carbonic anhydrase-containing cones. The sensitivity 
      loss is reversible and does not appear to be clinically significant. However, the 
      results suggest that patients administered acetazolamide should be excluded from 
      studies which compare the color vision of glaucomatous patients to that of 
      normals.

TI  - Blue-Black or White-Gold? Early Stage Processing and the Color of 'The Dress'.
PG  - e0161090
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0161090 [doi]
LID - e0161090
AB  - PURPOSE: In Feb 2015 an image of a dress posted on Tumblr triggered an internet 
      phenomenon: Is the Dress blue and black (BB) or white and gold (WG)? Many claim 
      BB and others insist WG while the true colors are BB. The prevailing theory is 
      that assumptions about the illuminant govern perception of the Dress with WG due 
      to bluish lighting and BB due to yellowish. Our purpose was to determine if early 
      stage optical, retinal and/or neural factors also impact perception of the Dress. 
      METHODS: Thirty-nine subjects were categorized as BB or WG based on their initial 
      perception of the Dress and their perception reported when viewing the Dress on 
      iPhone 5, iPad, and 22" LCD displays. Macular pigment optical density (MPOD) 
      measured with the QuantifEye™ MPS II and visual brainwaves (VEPs) in response to 
      brief presentations of a transparency of the Dress illuminated by a flashing 
      light were measured on each subject and compared between BB and WG groups. 
      Additionally, CIE chromaticity (color) and luminance (brightness) were measured 
      from multiple areas of the Dress image to determine cone stimulation and 
      contrast. RESULTS: Mean MPOD was higher in the WG group (0.49) vs. the BB (0.41, 
      p = 0.04) and median values were higher as well (WG = 0.46, BB = 0.36, p = 0.03). 
      There was no difference in VEP amplitude between groups (p > 0.85) but mean VEP 
      latency was longer in WG (130 msec.) vs. the BB group (107 msec., p = 0.0005). 
      Colorimetry of the Dress showed significantly greater stimulation of blue cones 
      (contrast = 73%) vs. red and green sensitive cones (contrast = 13%). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our findings indicate that observers with denser MPOD may be predisposed to 
      perceive the Dress as WG due to great absorption of blue light by the macular 
      pigment. Moreover, the novel, substantial stimulation of blue cones by the Dress 
      may contribute to ambiguity and dichotomous perception since the blue cones are 
      so sparse in the retina. Finally, the delayed WG VEPs indicate distinct neural 
      processing in perception of the consistent with fMRI evidence that the WG percept 
      is processed at higher cortical levels than the BB. These results do not fully 
      explain the dichotomous perception of the Dress but do exemplify the need to 
      consider early stage processing when elucidating ambiguous percepts and figures.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with outer retinal degeneration, a differential pupil 
      response to long wavelength (red) versus short wavelength (blue) light 
      stimulation has been previously observed. The goal of this study was to quantify 
      differences in the pupillary re-dilation following exposure to red versus blue 
      light in patients with outer retinal disease and compare them with patients with 
      optic neuropathy and with healthy subjects. DESIGN: Prospective comparative 
      cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-three patients with outer retinal disease, 13 
      patients with optic neuropathy and 14 normal subjects. METHODS: Subjects were 
      tested using continuous red and blue light stimulation at three intensities (1, 
      10 and 100 cd/m2) for 13 s per intensity. Pupillary re-dilation dynamics 
      following the brightest intensity was analysed and compared between the three 
      groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The parameters of pupil re-dilation used in this 
      study were: time to recover 90% of baseline size; mean pupil size at early and 
      late phases of re-dilation; and differential re-dilation time for blue versus red 
      light. RESULTS: Patients with outer retinal disease showed a pupil that tended to 
      stay smaller after light termination and thus had a longer time to recovery. The 
      differential re-dilation time was significantly greater in patients with outer 
      retinal disease (median = 28.0 s, P < 0.0001) compared with controls and patients 
      with optic neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: A differential response of pupil re-dilation 
      following red versus blue light stimulation is present in patients with outer 
      retinal disease but is not found in normal eyes or among patients with visual 
      loss from optic neuropathy.

LID - 10.1038/eye.2016.266 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, manufacturers and distributors have promoted commercially 
      available intraocular lenses (IOLs) with transmittance properties that filter 
      visible short-wavelength (blue) light on the basis of a putative photoprotective 
      effect. Systematic literature review. Out of 21 studies reporting on outcomes 
      following implantation of blue-light-filtering IOLs (involving 8914 patients and 
      12 919 study eyes undergoing cataract surgery), the primary outcome was vision, 
      sleep pattern, and photoprotection in 9 (42.9%), 9 (42.9%), and 3 (14.2%) 
      respectively, and, of these, only 7 (33.3%) can be classed as high as level 2b 
      (individual cohort study/low-quality randomized controlled trials), all other 
      studies being classed as level 3b or lower. Of the level 2b studies, only one 
      (14.3%) found in favor of blue-light-filtering IOLs vs ultraviolet (UV)-only 
      filtering IOLs on the basis of an association between better post-operative 
      contrast sensitivity (CS) at select frequencies with the former; however, that 
      study did not measure or report CS preoperatively in either group, and the 
      finding may simply reflect better preoperative CS in the eyes scheduled to be 
      implanted with the blue-light-filtering IOL; moreover, that study failed to 
      measure macular pigment, a natural preceptoral filter of blue-light, augmentation 
      of which is now known to improve CS. In terms of photoprotection, there is no 
      level 2b (or higher) evidence in support of blue filtering IOLs vs UV-only 
      filtering IOLs. On the basis of currently available evidence, one cannot advocate 
      for the use of blue-light-filtering IOLs over UV-only filtering IOLs.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate if a SN60AT <<Natural>> IOL (Alcon) with IMPRUV filter 
      (Alcon) offers any advantage in patients having cataract surgery, as compared 
      with Acrysof SA60 IOL (Alcon). METHODS: This was a prospective analytical study. 
      We studied sixty-four eyes from 32 patients with cataracts. After a random 
      assignment, phacoemulsification with the implant was performed using the Acrysof 
      SN60AT tinted lens in one eye and Acrysof SA60 in the other. A variety of 
      variables was subsequently assessed: contrast sensitivity with a CSV 1000E test, 
      colour perception through a Farnsworth 25 test and subjective measures by a 
      patient survey. Differences between the groups were assessed statistically. 
      RESULTS: The contrast sensitivity results were obtained for 3, 6, 12 and 18 
      cycles per degree (cpd) frequencies under scotopic conditions, with better 
      results obtained following the use of SN60AT: 0.75 (CSV 1000E test units) for 3 
      cpd, 0.86 for 6 cpd, 0.54 for 12 cpd and 0.35 for 18 cpd. The differences were 
      statistically significant between the two groups for 3 cpd and 6 cpd. A total of 
      62.5% of patients using a tinted lens and 50% with SA60 achieved good results in 
      the Farnsworth test; 12.5% and 21% had fair results and 25% and 28.1% 
      respectively had poor results. CONCLUSIONS: We obtained an improvement in favour 
      of the tinted lens for all frequencies, with this being statistically significant 
      at lower frequencies (3 and 6 cpd). No significant differences in the Farnsworth 
      test performance or in the patient survey were found. The tinting provided by the 
      IMPRUV filter brings an increase in contrast sensitivity without affecting colour 
      perception.

TI  - Colour vision and retinal nerve fibre layer photography in patients with an 
      Acrysof Natural intraocular lens.
PG  - 92-4
AB  - PURPOSE: To study colour vision and retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) photographs 
      in patients with an Acrysof Natural intraocular lens (IOL). METHODS: We carried 
      out a randomized double-blind study. An Acrysof Natural IOL (model SN60AT) was 
      implanted in 25 eyes of 19 patients and an Acrysof IOL (model SA60AT) was 
      implanted in 27 eyes of 18 control patients. The patients returned for colour 
      vision tests and fundus photography 1-6 months after the surgery. RESULTS: 
      Standard pseudoisochromatic plates, part 2, were correctly interpreted and the 
      Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test (FM 100) total and individual box scores were 
      normal in all IOL eyes. In the FM 100 hue test there were no significant 
      differences in the results of the total error scores or the error scores of the 
      individual boxes between the eyes with Acrysof Natural and those with Acrysof 
      lenses. The yellow coloration of the Acrysof Natural IOL did not affect the 
      visibility of the RNFL in photographs. CONCLUSIONS: The Acrysof Natural IOL did 
      not affect colour vision in the tested patients, even in the blue region of the 
      spectrum, and can be implanted in patients who need to have normal colour vision 
      for the purposes of their occupation. The Acrysof Natural IOL does not interfere 
      with RNFL photography and can also be used in patients with glaucoma.

TI  - Prospective, randomized, controlled clinical study evaluating the efficacy of 
      Rheopheresis for dry age-related macular degeneration. Dry AMD treatment with 
      Rheopheresis Trial-ART.
PG  - 1297-306
LID - 10.1007/s00417-009-1113-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate Rheopheresis for the treatment of patients with high-risk 
      dry age-related macular degeneration and no therapeutic alternative. Rheopheresis 
      is a method of therapeutic apheresis using the methodology of double filtration 
      plasmapheresis to treat microcirculatory disorders. METHODS: The dry AMD 
      treatment with Rheopheresis trial (ART) was a randomised, controlled clinical 
      study. Patients with the diagnosis of AMD in both eyes, with the study eye 
      presenting dry AMD and soft drusen (the fellow eye had advanced AMD) were 
      randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive ten Rheopheresis treatments within 17 
      weeks or to remain untreated. The primary outcome was change in best-corrected 
      ETDRS-visual acuity (mean logMar change) after 7.5 months compared to baseline 
      visual acuity for both groups. RESULTS: Forty-three eyes of 43 patients (22 
      treatment and 21 control group) were analysed. The mean baseline BCVA in study 
      eyes was 0.58 in the treatment group and 0.66 in the control group (n.s. p = 
      0.19). At the primary efficacy endpoint 7.5 months post baseline, there was a 
      statistically significant mean difference of 0.95 ETDRS lines (p = 0.01) between 
      the Rheopheresis and control groups. Nine percent of eyes in the group treated 
      with Rheopheresis gained 2 or more ETDRS lines, as compared with 0% of eyes with 
      no treatment. None of the treated patients had a loss in visual acuity in their 
      study eyes, as compared with 24% of patients without treatment who lost 1 ETDRS 
      line or more; 19% lost 2 ETDRS lines or more. Rheopheresis treatment was safe and 
      well-tolerated. CONCLUSION: The results of ART provide further evidence that 
      Rheopheresis is a safe and effective therapeutic option for high-risk patients 
      with dry AMD and no therapeutic alternative. A series of Rheopheresis treatments 
      can improve the natural course of AMD for selected patients.

AB  - An 85-year-old man with dry type age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in his 
      right eye and a disciform scar in his left eye received double-filtration 
      plasmapheresis (DFPP) for the treatment of his right eye. The protocol for 
      plasmapheresis followed the Multicenter Investigation of Rheopheresis for AMD 
      (MIRA) trial and consisted of four pulses of paired sessions of plasmapheresis 
      with a two-day interval within 10 weeks. The pre-DFPP best corrected visual 
      acuity (BCVA) for the right eye was 6/15 (0.4). Six months after DFPP treatment, 
      the BCVA of the right eye was 6/10 (0.6) and remained unchanged at the 12th 
      month; however, comparison of the right eye fundus picture, fluorescein 
      angiogram, and optical coherence tomography of the macular area before and 6 and 
      12 months after plasmapheresis revealed no discernable changes. The per-session 
      and per-course clearance rates were highest for IgM (63.8% and 90.8%) and lowest 
      for albumin (11% and 15.4%). No plasmapheresis-related complications, such as 
      hypotension, hemolysis or infection, occurred. Thus, DFPP treatment can provide 
      effective treatment for dry type AMD with minimal side-effects.

TI  - Fasting plasma zeaxanthin response to Fructus barbarum L. (wolfberry; Kei Tze) in 
      a food-based human supplementation trial.
PG  - 123-30
AB  - Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common disorder that causes 
      irreversible loss of central vision. Increased intake of foods containing 
      zeaxanthin may be effective in preventing AMD because the macula accumulates 
      zeaxanthin and lutein, oxygenated carotenoids with antioxidant and blue 
      light-absorbing properties. Lycium barbarum L. is a small red berry known as 
      Fructus lycii and wolfberry in the West, and Kei Tze and Gou Qi Zi in Asia. 
      Wolfberry is rich in zeaxanthin dipalmitate, and is valued in Chinese culture for 
      being good for vision. The aim of this study, which was a single-blinded, 
      placebo-controlled, human intervention trial of parallel design, was to provide 
      data on how fasting plasma zeaxanthin concentration changes as a result of 
      dietary supplementation with whole wolfberries. Fasting blood was collected from 
      healthy, consenting subjects; fourteen subjects took 15 g/d wolfberry (estimated 
      to contain almost 3 mg zeaxanthin) for 28 d. Repeat fasting blood was collected 
      on day 29. Age- and sex-matched controls (n 13) took no wolfberry. Responses in 
      the two groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. After supplementation, 
      plasma zeaxanthin increased 2.5-fold: mean values on day 1 and 29 were 0.038 (sem 
      0.003) and 0.096 (sem 0.009) micromol/l (P<0.01), respectively, for the 
      supplementation group; and 0.038 (sem 0.003) and 0.043 (sem 0.003) micromol/l 
      (P>0.05), respectively, for the control group. This human supplementation trial 
      shows that zeaxanthin in whole wolfberries is bioavailable and that intake of a 
      modest daily amount markedly increases fasting plasma zeaxanthin levels. These 
      new data will support further study of dietary strategies to maintain macular 
      pigment density.

TI  - [Evaluation of colour vision according to type of implanted artificial foldable 
      intraocular lens].
PG  - 266-9
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of research was comparing the colour vision of patients with 
      blue light filtering artificial lens to the patients with implant without blue 
      light filter. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 99 patients (120 eyes) divided on three 
      groups were examined. 40 patients (40 eyes) after cataract surgery with 
      implantation of blue light filtering lens were the first group. 39 patients (40 
      eyes) who had implanted lens without filter were the second group. 20 patients 
      (40 eyes) with own transparent lens were the third group. Farnsworth-Munsell 100 
      Hue test was used in research. Each patient made test on thirtieth day after 
      cataract surgery. RESULTS: Following average total error score (TES) values in 
      groups were observed: the first group--60.66, the second group--83.71, the third 
      group--61.55. Average axis of disorder in blue-yellow range was following: 
      patients after cataract surgery with implantation of blue light filtering 
      lens--5.48, patients with implant without blue light filter--7.28, control 
      group--5.74. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Kind of artificial intraocular lens has meaning in 
      colour vision at pseudophakic patients. 2. Blue light filter of artificial 
      intraocular foldable lens advantageously effects perception of colours. 3. Lack 
      of blue light filter in artificial intraocular lens gets worse colour vision 
      especially in blue-yellow range.

      placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 221-32
LID - 10.1111/bdi.12390 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The discovery of the blue lightsensitive retinal photoreceptor 
      responsible for signaling daytime to the brain suggested that light to the 
      circadian system could be inhibited by using blue-blocking orange tinted glasses. 
      Blue-blocking (BB) glasses are a potential treatment option for bipolar mania. We 
      examined the effectiveness of BB glasses in hospitalized patients with bipolar 
      disorder in a manic state. METHODS: In a single-blinded, randomized, 
      placebo-controlled trial (RCT), eligible patients (with bipolar mania; age 
      18-70 years) were recruited from five clinics in Norway. Patients were assigned 
      to BB glasses or placebo (clear glasses) from 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. for 7 days, in 
      addition to treatment as usual. Symptoms were assessed daily by use of the Young 
      Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Motor activity was assessed by actigraphy, and 
      compared to data from a healthy control group. Wearing glasses for one 
      evening/night qualified for inclusion in the intention-to-treat analysis. 
      RESULTS: From February 2012 to February 2015, 32 patients were enrolled. Eight 
      patients dropped out and one was excluded, resulting in 12 patients in the BB 
      group and 11 patients in the placebo group. The mean decline in YMRS score was 
      14.1 [95% confidence interval (CI): 9.7-18.5] in the BB group, and 1.7 (95% CI: 
      -4.0 to 7.4) in the placebo group, yielding an effect size of 1.86 (Cohen's d). 
      In the BB group, one patient reported headache and two patients experienced 
      easily reversible depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This RCT shows that BB 
      glasses are effective and feasible as add-on treatment for bipolar mania.

TI  - Light energy, cataract surgery, and progression of age-related macular 
      degeneration.
PG  - 166-9
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Some studies suggest an association between light exposure and 
      increased risk of advanced age-related macular degeneration. The natural lens 
      serves as a barrier to some of the higher energy light rays. There is some 
      concern that cataract surgery may be contributing to the increase in prevalence 
      of age-related macular degeneration. RECENT FINDINGS: It has been shown that blue 
      light absorption by retinal pigment epithelium results in free radical formation, 
      leading to cellular injury, and that blue filters can reduce this rate of cell 
      death. Other studies have shown a tendency for pseudophakic eyes to progress to 
      the wet form of age-related macular degeneration more so than their fellow eyes. 
      SUMMARY: Currently there is no conclusive evidence to support a relation between 
      progression of age-related macular degeneration and cataract surgery. Given that 
      nearly two million cataract extractions are performed yearly, a large randomized 
      controlled study is required to prove or disprove the ability of tinted 
      intraocular lenses to aid in preventing the progression of age-related macular 
      degeneration.

TI  - Iris color and visual functions.
PG  - 195-202
LID - 10.1007/s00417-012-2006-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate if iris color is associated 
      with differences in visual functions such as intraocular straylight (IOSL), 
      contrast sensitivity (CS), or best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). METHODS: In 
      this retrospective cohort study, which is a subgroup analysis of a large 
      prospective trial about visual impairments in European car drivers, we included 
      853 persons between 20 and 80 years of age and without a history of ocular 
      surgery or any eye disease including cataract. Subjects participated in an 
      ophthalmological examination, grading of lens opacity, and the measurement of 
      visual functions such as IOSL, CS, and BCVA. Dependent on iris color, 
      participants were divided into four groups: light-blue, blue-grey, green-hazel, 
      and brown. RESULTS: Independent of age, IOSL was significantly (all p values < 
      0.0001, Fisher's LSD test) higher in participants with light-blue colored iris 
      (1.14 log(IOSL) [95 % CI: 1.11-1.17]) compared to participants with blue-grey 
      (1.07 log(IOSL) [95 % CI: 1.05-1.09]), green-hazel (1.06 log(IOSL) [95 % CI: 
      1.04-1.08]) or brown (1.06 log(IOSL) [95 % CI: 1.04-1.08]) iris color. CS was 
      also lower in participants with light-blue pigmented irises (1.60 log(CS) [95 % 
      CI: 1.58-1.62]) than in the other groups, but statistically significant (p = 
      0.013, Fisher's LSD test) only compared to brown iris color. For BCVA we could 
      not found any difference between the four groups. CONCLUSIONS: We could show in 
      this study that iris color has a significant impact on IOSL and to a lower degree 
      on CS, but not on BCVA. Persons with light-blue iris color who showed 
      significantly higher IOSL values therefore may experience disability glare in 
      daily situations such as driving at night more often than others.

TI  - Study of blue and red flash in dark-adapted electroretinogram.
PG  - 106-11
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the characteristics of the waveform generated by blue and 
      red light stimulations in a dark-adapted electroretinogram (ERG) and those of 
      cone responses in the dark-adapted condition. METHODS: The study subjects were 52 
      persons (88 eyes) with no previous medical history. The author recorded b-waves 
      (rod response) with red light stimulation and the x-waves (dark-adapted cone 
      response) that appeared before the b-waves. The author also recorded b-waves with 
      blue light stimulation, which had the same amplitude as the b-waves from the red 
      light stimulation. The differences with respect to age and gender were studied. 
      Waveforms of the dark-adapted cone ERGs were recorded by using a digital 
      subtraction technique. RESULTS: The x-wave always appeared before the b-wave with 
      0 dB (2.4 cd.s/m2) red stimulation. With blue stimulation, a b-wave equivalent to 
      the b-wave stimulated with the red light of 0 dB intensity appeared at an average 
      of -14.57 dB. The implicit time for the b-wave was delayed significantly for the 
      male group. There were no significant differences between different age groups. 
      The dark-adapted cone ERG demonstrated the waveform of a negative response 
      followed by a series of oscillatory potentials (OPs) and a positive response. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The cone responses were followed by the rod responses with red light 
      stimulation of 0 dB in the dark-adapted ERG. The waveforms of the cone ERGs were 
      obtained in dark adaptation with red and blue light stimulation.

TI  - Amber lenses to block blue light and improve sleep: a randomized trial.
PG  - 1602-12
LID - 10.3109/07420520903523719 [doi]
AB  - All light is not equal: blue wavelengths are the most potent portion of the 
      visible electromagnetic spectrum for circadian regulation. Therefore, blocking 
      blue light could create a form of physiologic darkness. Because the timing and 
      quantity of light and darkness both affect sleep, evening use of amber lenses to 
      block blue light might affect sleep quality. Mood is also affected by light and 
      sleep; therefore, mood might be affected by blue light blockade. In this study, 
      20 adult volunteers were randomized to wear either blue-blocking (amber) or 
      yellow-tinted (blocking ultraviolet only) safety glasses for 3 h prior to sleep. 
      Participants completed sleep diaries during a one-week baseline assessment and 
      two weeks' use of glasses. Outcome measures were subjective: change in overall 
      sleep quality and positive/negative affect. Results demonstrated that sleep 
      quality at study outset was poorer in the amber lens than the control group. Two- 
      by three-way ANOVA revealed significant (p < .001) interaction between quality of 
      sleep over the three weeks and experimental condition. At the end of the study, 
      the amber lens group experienced significant (p < .001) improvement in sleep 
      quality relative to the control group and positive affect (p = .005). Mood also 
      improved significantly relative to controls. A replication with more detailed 
      data on the subjects' circadian baseline and objective outcome measures is 
      warranted.

TI  - Do blue light filters confer protection against age-related macular degeneration?
PG  - 523-31
AB  - Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major health problem in the developed 
      world accounting for approximately half of all blind registrations. Current 
      treatment options are unsuitable for the majority of patients and therefore the 
      identification of modifiable risk factors that may inform disease prevention 
      programmes is a priority. This review evaluates the long-held belief that blue 
      light exposure has a role in the pathogenesis of AMD. Laboratory evidence has 
      demonstrated that photochemical reactions in the oxygen-rich environment of the 
      outer retina lead to the liberation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). 
      These ROS cause oxidative stress which is known to contribute to the development 
      of AMD. The precise chromopore that may be involved in the pathogenesis of AMD is 
      unclear but the age pigment lipofuscin is a likely candidate. Its aerobic 
      photoreactivity and adverse effects on antioxidant activity combined with its 
      gradual accumulation over time suggests that its in vivo phototoxicity increases 
      with age despite changes in the absorption characteristics of the crystalline 
      lens. Evidence from animal studies confirms blue light's damaging potential but 
      the results are not directly applicable to macular degeneration in humans. 
      Studies of human macular pigment density and the risk of AMD progression 
      following cataract surgery lend further weight to the hypothesis that blue light 
      exposure has a role in the pathogenesis of AMD but the epidemiological evidence 
      is equivocal. On balance the evidences suggests but does not yet confirm that 
      blue light is a risk factor for AMD. Given the socio-economic impact of this 
      disease and urgent need to identify modifiable risk factors, future work should 
      include a large-scale clinical trial to evaluate the effect of blue blocking 
      filters on AMD progression rates.

TI  - The influence of decreased retinal illumination on automated perimetric threshold 
      measurements.
PG  - 643-50
AB  - Decreased retinal illumination (such as can be caused by pupillary constriction 
      or light absorption by ocular media opacities) was simulated with a randomly 
      ordered series of neutral density filters in front of the right eyes of five 
      subjects with dilated pupils. Threshold measurements were performed on Humphrey 
      and Octopus perimeters at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 degrees nasally along the 
      180-degree meridian. A 0.6-log unit neutral density filter, which reduces retinal 
      illumination the equivalent of halving the pupillary diameter, decreased the mean 
      Humphrey thresholds by 1.1 +/- 0.8 decibels (dB) (mean +/- standard deviation) 
      and the mean Octopus thresholds by 1.7 +/- 1.4 dB. Statistically significant (P 
      less than or equal to .05, Dunnett's test) threshold depressions were observed at 
      all eccentricities with a 1.5-log unit neutral density filter on the Humphrey 
      perimeter (-4.5 +/- 0.7 dB) and with a 1.0-log unit neutral density filter on the 
      Octopus perimeter (-3.5 +/- 1.0 dB).

TI  - Preventive effect of Vaccinium uliginosum L. extract and its fractions on 
      age-related macular degeneration and its action mechanisms.
PG  - 21-32
LID - 10.1007/s12272-015-0683-7 [doi]
AB  - Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss and 
      blindness among the elderly. Although the pathogenesis of this disease remains 
      still obscure, several researchers have report that death of retinal pigmented 
      epithelium (RPE) caused by excessive accumulation of A2E is crucial determinants 
      of AMD. In this study, the preventive effect of Vaccinium uliginosum L. (V.U) 
      extract and its fractions on AMD was investigated in blue light-irradiated human 
      RPE cell (ARPE-19 cells). Blue light-induced RPE cell death was significantly 
      inhibited by the treatment of V.U extract or its fraction. To identify the 
      mechanism, FAB-MS analysis revealed that V.U inhibits the photooxidation of 
      N-retinyl-N-retinylidene ethanolamine (A2E) induced by blue light in cell free 
      system. Moreover, monitoring by quantitative HPLC also revealed that V.U extract 
      and its fractions reduced intracellular accumulation of A2E, suggesting that V.U 
      extract and its fractions inhibit not only blue light-induced photooxidation, but 
      also intracellular accumulation of A2E, resulting in RPE cell survival after blue 
      light exposure. A2E-laden cell exposed to blue light induced apoptosis by 
      increasing the cleaved form of caspase-3, Bax/Bcl-2. Additionally, V.U inhibited 
      by the treatment of V.U extract or quercetin-3-O-arabinofuranoside. These results 
      suggest that V.U extract and its fractions have preventive effect on blue 
      light-induced damage in RPE cells and AMD.

TI  - Surgical findings with the tinted AcrySof intraocular lens in children.
PG  - 166-9
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The AcrySof foldable acrylic intraocular lens (IOL) has become an 
      accepted and frequent means of treating pediatric aphakia. A new version of this 
      lens with blue-light filtering properties purports to offer superior retinal 
      protection. We describe our experience with this tinted lens and compare it to 
      findings with the standard, nontinted IOL. METHODS: A chart review identified 29 
      eyes of 21 children (tinted lens group; age 11 months to 13 years) who had the 
      tinted IOL implanted. The standard lens group consisted of 38 eyes (31 patients; 
      age 11 months to 15 years). Most eyes had an intact posterior capsule at the time 
      of implantation. RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative inflammation was fairly 
      high in both groups (71% in the tinted lens group, 60% in the standard lens 
      group). The tinted lens group showed a higher incidence of transient inflammation 
      than the standard lens group (p=0.03) but the rates of nontransient sequelae 
      (posterior synechiae, iris synechiae, membranes formation, capsule, or IOL 
      opacification) were similar (66% versus 47%; p=0.11). Posterior capsule 
      opacification occurred in 15 eyes in the tinted lens group and 16 eyes in the 
      standard lens group (p=0.15) but was visually significant in only 10 and 11 eyes, 
      respectively (p=0.77). CONCLUSIONS: Transient inflammation is higher with 
      implantation of tinted versus nontinted IOLs, but long-term inflammatory sequelae 
      are roughly equal, as is the rate of posterior capsule opacification. The 
      question as to whether the chromophore in the tinted lens caused the higher 
      incidence of transient inflammation is unresolved.

TI  - Quality-of-life improvements in cataract patients with bilateral blue 
      light-filtering intraocular lenses: clinical trial.
PG  - 1952-9
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare change in patient-reported vision-related and health-related 
      functioning and quality of life (HRQOL) following bilateral implantation with a 
      new blue light-filtering intraocular lens (IOL) with the results of a similar IOL 
      that does not filter blue light. SETTING: Six clinical sites in the United 
      States. METHODS: Patients were from 6 clinical sites in the United States that 
      performed a high volume of cataract surgeries. The HRQOL assessments occurred via 
      telephone while patients were at home. Patients requiring bilateral cataract 
      extraction were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 IOL groups for the first eye. The 
      second eye was later implanted with the same type of IOL. Patients and HRQOL data 
      collectors were treatment-masked, but investigators could not be. Health-related 
      functioning and quality of life was measured with the 39-item National Eye 
      Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-39) and 12-item Short Form 
      Health Survey (SF-12). Assessments were at baseline before implantation in the 
      first eye and 30 to 60 days and 120 to 180 days after implantation of the lens in 
      the second eye. RESULTS: Both IOL types improved most aspects of patients' HRQOL 
      including color vision and driving. The largest gains occurred on the VFQ 
      composite, general vision, near activities, distance activities, driving, mental 
      health, peripheral vision, and role difficulties scales. Significant gains also 
      occurred on color vision and other vision-specific scales as well as the SF-12 
      physical component summary score. There were no significant differences in HRQOL 
      gains between the IOLs. CONCLUSION: The blue light-filtering IOL improved color 
      vision, driving, and other aspects of HRQOL in a manner similar to that of a lens 
      that does not filter blue light.

TI  - Fellow-eye comparison of posterior capsule opacification with AcrySof SN60AT and 
      AF-1 YA-60BB blue-blocking intraocular lenses.
PG  - 1489-94
LID - 10.1016/j.jcrs.2008.05.024 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate intraindividual differences in posterior capsule 
      opacification (PCO) and visual performance of AcrySof SN60AT (Alcon Laboratories) 
      and AF-1 YA-60BB (Hoya Corp.) intraocular lenses (IOLs). SETTING: Ophthalmology 
      Department, St. Thomas' Hospital, London, United Kingdom. METHODS: In this 
      prospective single-surgeon standardized-surgical-procedure fellow-eye comparison, 
      an AcrySof SN60AT or an AF-1 YA-60BB IOL was randomized to the first eye of 36 
      patients and fellow-eye surgery was performed within 4 to 6 weeks. Follow-up was 
      at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Best distance- corrected logMAR visual acuity was 
      measured at 100% and 9% contrast. Contrast sensitivity was measured using the 
      Functional Acuity Contrast Test (FACT) on the Optec 3500 instrument (Stereo 
      Optical Company, Inc.). Color vision was assessed with the Farnsworth Munsell 
      100-hue test. After pupil dilation, digital retroillumination photographs were 
      taken and the percentage area of PCO was calculated using POCO software. RESULTS: 
      Posterior capsule opacification was significantly greater in the AF-1 YA-60BB 
      group than in the AcrySof SN60AT group at all time points (P<.0001), with the 
      difference greatest at 24 months. At 24 months, 100% contrast visual acuity was 
      significantly better in the AcrySof SN60AT group than in the AF-1 YA-60BB group 
      (P = .0313); 9% contrast visual acuity was significantly better in the AcrySof 
      SN60AT group from 6 months onward. There was no significant difference between 
      groups in color vision or contrast sensitivity. Electron microscopy showed the 
      AcrySof SN60AT IOL has a much sharper posterior edge profile. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      AcrySof SN60AT IOL had better PCO performance and thus visual performance than 
      the AF-1 YA-60BB IOL. This is attributable to the differences in optic edge 
      design.

TI  - [The correlation between the concentrations of VEGF and PEDF and Ca2+-PKC 
      signaling pathways in human retinal pigment epithelial cells cultured in vitro 
      after exposuring to blue light].
PG  - 839-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the concentrations of vascular endothelial growth 
      factor (VEGF), pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), inositol triphosphate 
      (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) in human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells 
      after exposuring to blue light, and to explore the relationship with Ca2+-PKC 
      signaling pathways, to evaluate the role of Ca2+-PKC signaling pathways of 
      blue-light irradiation induced apoptosis in RPE cells. METHODS: The fourth 
      generation human RPE cells in vitro were exposured to blue light (2000±500 lux) 
      for 6 hours, 24 hours prolongation of post-exposure culture. The concentrations 
      of VEGF, PEDF, IP3 and DAG were assayed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay 
      (ELISA). Cells were randomly divided into 6 groups, group A (control), group B 
      (exposure to blue light), group C (exposure to blue light+PMA), group D (exposure 
      to blue light+Calphostin C), group E (exposure to blue light+Nifedipine), group F 
      (exposure to blue light+Calphostin C+Nifedipine). Flow cytometry was used to 
      detect the apoptosis rate of human RPE cells in A, B and F group. RESULTS: 
      Comparing with group A (584.38±10.66), the concentration of VEGF in group B 
      (700.70±5.88), group C (698.21±6.66) and group E (648.30±4.91) was higher, the 
      difference was statistically significant (P=0.002, 0.002, 0.016). Comparing with 
      group B (700.70±5.88), the concentration of VEGF in Group D (623.87±3.12) and E 
      (648.30±4.91) was lower (P=0.001, 0.002). Comparing with group A (75.96±1.70), 
      the concentration of PEDF in Group B (71.82±1.67) and C (72.43±0.58) was lower 
      (P=0.004, 0.011), but the concentration of PEDF in Group D (86.31±1.35) and E 
      (93.72±1.24) was higher (P=0.000, 0.000). Comparing with group B (71.82±1.67), 
      the concentration of PEDF in Group D (86.31±1.35) and E (93.72±1.24) was higher 
      (P=0.000, 0.000). Comparing with group A (7.70±0.29), the ratio of VEGF to PEDF 
      in Group B (9.85±0.34) and Croup C (9.64±0.02) was higher (P=0.008, 0.027) 
      Comparing with group B, The ratio of VEGF to PEDF in Group D (7.23±0.08) and E 
      (6.92±0.06) was lower (P=0.016, 0.015). Comparing with group A (108.42±0.75, 
      995.47± 13.61), the concentration of IP3 and DAG in Group B (117.24±1.06, 
      1070.10±10.07), C (137.12±2.71, 1046.40±7.90), D (139.17±1.40, 1041.13±9.76) and 
      E (149.61±0.77, 1273.14±10.89) was higher, the difference was statistically 
      significant (P=0.003, 0.007, 0.000, 0.000, 0.000, 0.000, 0.000, 0.000). Comparing 
      with group B, the concentration of IP3 in Group C, D and E was higher (P=0.011, 
      0.000, 0.000). Comparing with group B, the concentration of DAG in Group C and D 
      was lower (P=0.021, 0.007). Comparing with group B, the concentration of DAG in 
      Group E was higher (P=0.000). Comparing with group A (10.27±1.88), the apoptosis 
      rate of RPE cells in Group B(25.07±2.66) and F(19.37±3.23) was higher, the 
      difference was statistically significant (P=0.001, 0.009). Comparing with group B 
      (25.07±2.66), the apoptosis rate of RPE cells in Group F (19.37±3.23) was lower 
      (P=0.038). CONCLUSIONS: (1) After exposuring to blue light, the concentrations of 
      VEGF, IP3 and DAG are increased and the ratio of VEGF to PEDF is also increased 
      and the concentration of PEDF is decreased in human RPE cells. (2) L-Type Calcium 
      Channels and Ca2+-PKC signaling pathways may be regulate the concentrations of 
      VEGF, PEDF, IP3 and DAG in RPE cells after exposuring to blue light by feedback 
      regulation. (3) The application of Calphostin C combined with Nifedipine may be 
      restrain the apoptosis of RPE cells after exposuring to blue light.

AB  - The risk of anterior chamber microbial or particulate contamination or both 
      during extracapsular cataract extraction has increased because of the need for 
      large volumes of irrigating solution during the procedure. I performed a clinical 
      trial using an in-line microfiltration apparatus fitted with a 0.8 micron filter. 
      After passing 500 ml volume bottles of each of six manufacturers' irrigating 
      solutions through individual filters, a variety of particulate matter was 
      observed to be trapped by the filter. In addition, I had samples of 500 ml 
      bottles from each of seven manufacturers' irrigating solutions analyzed 
      independently. This independent analysis involved the determination of 
      particulate counts by Coulter counter analysis and photographic documentation of 
      the particulate matter found in the samples. All the solutions were found to 
      contain some particulate matter. The quantity found ranged from as few as 20 
      particles per ml to as many as 2,400 particles per ml. The results of this study 
      support the use of an in-line microfiltration apparatus during planned 
      extracapsular and phacoemulsification cataract surgery.

TI  - [The clinical investigation of dynamic changes of corneal astigmatism and visual 
      quality for patients after phacoemulsification surgery through different incision 
      and implantation of different designed intraocular lens].
PG  - 424-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the corneal astigmatism and wavefront aberration 
      differences of patients with cataract coexisting corneal astigmatism after 
      phacoemulsification surgery through traditional superior clear corneal incision 
      or phacoemulsification surgery through clear corneal incision guided by corneal 
      topography and implantation of different spherical aberration intraocular lenses 
      (IOL). METHODS: In a prospective randomized sample controlled clinical trial, 90 
      patients (90 eyes) with age-related cataract and corneal astigmatism were 
      randomly divided into 3 groups: (Group A) traditional superior corneal incision 
      phacoemulsification surgery and AcrySof SN60AT IOL implantation, (Group B) 
      corneal topography guiding incision phacoemulsification surgery and AcrySof 
      SN60AT IOL implantation and (Group C) corneal topography guiding incision 
      phacoemulsification surgery and AcrySof SN60WF IOL implantation. Corneal 
      topography tests were performed at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months 
      postoperatively. The Wavefront aberration was measured using a custom built 
      Tscherning wavefront sensor-ALLEGRETTO WAVE Analyze at 90 days postoperatively. 
      Third-, 4th-, 5th-, total and higher-order aberration (HOA) root-mean-square 
      (RMS), spherical aberration and coma aberration were compared at virtual pupil 
      diameters of 6 mm postoperatively. Statistical analyses were performed using the 
      analysis of chi square test, repeated measurement data analysis of variance, 
      one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and multiple comparisons 
      Students-Newman-Keuls test. RESULTS: Corneal topography tests indicated that no 
      significant difference for corneal astigmatism was found between these three 
      groups preoperatively (F = 0.08, P > 0.05). The corneal astigmatism was 
      decomposed into J(0), J(45) and P with a Vector-based method, and statistically 
      analyzed. When compared with Group B and GroupC, Group A had higher values of 
      corneal J(0) (F = 9.54, P < 0.01) and P (F = 18.69, P < 0.01). For corneal J(0) 
      and P, no significant difference was found between Group B and Group C (P > 
      0.05). However groups and times had interactions (F = 13.45, 50.22, P < 0.01, 
      respectively). For astigmatic vectors, there were statistical significances 
      between different times in 3 groups (F = 74.33, 92.11, P < 0.01, respectively). 
      Wavefront aberration test results indicated that the mean values of RMSg (root 
      mean square of general aberration), coma aberration, RMSh, RMS(3), RMS(5) and 
      RMS(6) of Group A were obviously higher than that of Group B and C (F = 93.40, 
      471.94, 176.95, 216.99, 44.37, 37.19, P < 0.01, respectively). And the values of 
      RMS(4) and spherical aberration in Group A were significantly higher than that in 
      Group C (q = 25.30, 26.23, P < 0.01, respectively). No statistically significant 
      was found between Group A and Group B of RMS(4) and spherical aberration (q = 
      0.57, 2.34, P > 0.05, respectively). The values of RMS(4), RMSh, RMSg and 
      spherical aberration in Group B were statistically significantly higher than that 
      in Group C (q = 24.73, 7.90, 6.41, 23.89, P < 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Corneal topography guiding incision phacoemulsification surgery and the 
      implantation of negative spherical aberration IOL is a more favorable solution 
      for cataract patients coexisting corneal astigmatism, which can correct the 
      corneal astigmatism, decrease the spherical aberration, high-order aberration and 
      general aberration of pseudophakic eyes and therefore improve the visual quality 
      of patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a need for improved predictability in cataract surgery. The 
      aim of this study was to investigate whether implantation of intraocular lenses 
      (IOLs) with accurately labeled dioptric power could improve the postoperative 
      results and allow better predictability. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 113 eyes were 
      implanted with Crystal Evolution® (MTO) IOLs and 261 eyes with AF-1 iMics1® 
      (Hoya) IOLs. The predictability of the postoperative spherical equivalence (SE) 
      and the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were compared between both groups. 
      The predictability was also compared to 2 previous studies. RESULTS: With Crystal 
      Evolution®, the predictability was significantly better than with AF-1 iMics1® 
      (p<0.0001). The results were also better than those described in the 2 studies. 
      Although the BCVA obtained with Crystal Evolution® were better than with AF-1 
      iMics1®, the difference were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that 
      accurate dioptric labeling of IOLs may improve the postoperative refraction 
      outcome.

TI  - Prospective randomized study of clinical performance of 3 aspheric and 2 
      spherical intraocular lenses in 250 eyes.
PG  - 639-48
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the quality of vision with aspheric and spherical intraocular 
      lenses (IOLs) in pseudophakic patients. METHODS: This prospective, comparative, 
      randomized study included 250 eyes of 125 patients with bilateral cataracts. 
      Patients were randomly assigned to receive either IOLs with a spherical biconvex 
      optic (Acrysof SN6OAT [Alcon] or Sensar AR40e [Advanced Medical Optics, AMO]) or 
      IOLs with an aspheric optic (Acrysof IQ SN6OWF [Alcon], Tecnis Z9000 [AMO], or 
      Sofport L161AO [Bausch & Lomb]). Ophthalmologic examination including best 
      spectacle-corrected visual acuity, pupil size, ocular dominance investigation, 
      contrast sensitivity under mesopic and photopic conditions, and wavefront 
      analysis was performed 2 months postoperatively. RESULTS: Aspheric IOLs showed 
      better contrast sensitivity compared to spherical IOLs at spatial frequencies of 
      6, 12, and 18 cycles per degree (cpd) under photopic conditions and at all 
      spatial frequencies under mesopic conditions. There was no significant difference 
      among the three aspheric IOLs at all spatial frequencies under either photopic or 
      mesopic conditions. Mean total spherical aberration was statistically lower in 
      dominant eyes with aspheric IOLs (0.05 +/- 0.06, 0.11 +/- 0.1, and 0.19 +/- 0.08 
      pm for the Tecnis Z9000, Acrysof IQ SN6OWF, and Sofport L161AO, respectively) 
      compared with eyes with spherical IOLs (0.62 +/- 0.24 and 0.46 +/- 0.19 microm 
      for the Acrysof SN6OAT and Sensar AR40e, respectively) for a 5-mm pupil diameter. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The aspheric IOLs had less wavefront aberrations and performed 
      better under both photopic and mesopic contrast sensitivity compared to the 
      spherical IOLs. These findings confirm it is possible to improve the optical 
      performance of IOLs by modifying the surfaces.

TI  - In vivo assessment of higher-order aberrations after AcrySof toric intraocular 
      lens implantation: a comparative study.
PG  - 531-40
LID - 10.5301/ejo.5000090 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare higher-order aberrations (HOAs) and optical quality in eyes 
      implanted with AcrySof SN60TT toric intraocular lens (IOL) or with non-toric 
      AcrySof SN60AT IOL (Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX). METHODS: This was 
      a prospective, consecutive, nonrandomized, interventional, comparative study. One 
      hundred eyes with cataract in 56 patients were included (SN60TT group, n=50; 
      SN60AT group, n=50). Patients underwent phacoemulsification through a 2.2-mm 
      temporal corneal incision. Postoperative HOAs, point spread function (PSF) and 
      modulation transfer function (MTF), residual objective refractive astigmatism, 
      and IOL alignment were evaluated using Optical Path Difference (OPD)-Scan II 
      (Nidek, Gamagori, Japan). A novel technique to calculate IOL axis alignment was 
      introduced. RESULTS: One year postoperatively, no statistical difference in 
      corneal, intraocular, and total HOAs, Strehl ratio, and MTF based on HOAs was 
      found between groups. Toric IOL patients had a net residual refractive 
      astigmatism (M) of 0.44 D±0.47; the difference between expected and obtained 
      astigmatism (M) was 0.043 D (p=0.16). Toric IOL axis misalignment was 2.65±2.39 
      degrees and no correlation with HOAs was found. CONCLUSIONS: AcrySof SN60TT 
      determines HOAs comparable to the non-toric version providing a good optical 
      quality, and predictably corrects corneal cylinder with a stable postoperative 
      alignment. The OPD-Scan II might be regarded as a fast and reliable method of 
      toric IOL analysis.

AB  - Lutein is selectively taken up by the primate retina and plays an important role 
      as a filter for harmful blue light and as an antioxidant. Recent studies have 
      shown that lutein has systemic anti-inflammatory properties. Dietary lutein has 
      been associated with reduced circulating levels of inflammatory biomarkers such 
      as CRP and sICAM. Whether lutein also affects activation of the complement system 
      has not yet been addressed and was the purpose of the study described here. 
      Seventy-two subjects with signs of early macular degeneration were randomly 
      assigned to receive either a 10 mg lutein supplement or a placebo during one 
      year. EDTA blood samples were collected at 0, 4, 8 and 12 months. Complement 
      factor D (CFD), a rate limiting component of the alternative pathway of 
      complement activation and the complement activation products C5a and C3d were 
      determined in the plasma samples by ELISA. A significant 0.11 µg/ml monthly 
      decrease in plasma CFD concentration was observed in the lutein group (p<0.001), 
      resulting in a 51% decrease from 2.3 µg/ml at baseline to 1.0 µg/ml at 12 months. 
      The C5a concentration showed a significant 0.063ng/ml monthly decrease in the 
      lutein group (p<0.001) resulting in a 36% decrease from 2.2ng/ml at baseline to 
      1.6ng/ml at 12 months. The C3d concentration showed a significant 0.19µg/ml 
      monthly decrease in the lutein group (p=0.004) that gave rise to a 9% decrease 
      from 15.4µg/ml at baseline to 14.4µg/ml at 12 months. In the placebo group we 
      found a significant 0.04 µg/ml monthly decrease in plasma CFD concentration, 
      whereas no changes were observed for C5a and C3d. Lutein supplementation markedly 
      decreases circulating levels of the complement factors CFD, C5a and C3d levels, 
      which might allow a simple method to control this inflammatory pathway of the 
      innate immune system.

TI  - Blue light-absorbing intraocular lens and retinal pigment epithelium protection 
      in vitro.
PG  - 873-8
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the Alcon AcrySof Natural (SN60AT) and AcrySof (SA60AT), the 
      AMO Sensar (AR40e) and ClariFlex, and the Pfizer CeeOn Edge 911A intraocular 
      lenses (IOLs) as to their ability to protect retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) 
      cells from light damage mediated by the lipofuscin fluorophore A2E. SETTING: 
      Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA. 
      METHODS: Cultured human RPE cells (ARPE-19 cell line) that had accumulated A2E 
      were exposed to blue (430 nm +/- 30), green (550 +/- 10 nm), or white (390 to 750 
      nm) light with and without an IOL in the light path. RESULTS: The blue 
      light-absorbing AcrySof Natural IOL was associated with significant reduction 
      (78% to 82%; P<.01) in the death of A2E-laden RPE that were exposed to blue, 
      white, and green light. The decrease in the incidence of cell death was greater 
      in magnitude than would be expected from the amount of light that was absorbed by 
      the IOL. The considerably smaller declines in cell death observed with the 
      AcrySof, Sensar, ClariFlex, and CeeOn Edge IOLs were likely due to nonspecific 
      reductions in light transmittance. CONCLUSIONS: By absorbing blue light, the 
      AcrySof Natural IOL shields RPE cells that have accumulated the aging lipofuscin 
      fluorophore A2E from the damaging effects of light. A long-term population-based 
      clinical trial would determine whether a blue light-absorbing IOL can reduce the 
      risk for or progression of age-related macular degeneration.

TI  - [Clinical observation of visual quality after implantation of toric intraocular 
      lens].
PG  - 908-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the visual quality after implantation of Acrysof toric 
      intraocular lens (IOL) in cataract patients. METHODS: Eighty eyes (60 patients) 
      had implantation of Acrysof toric IOL in our hospital between Oct. 2009 and Sep. 
      2010. The patients were divided into four groups according to the toric models 
      (T3, T4 and T5). The uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best corrected visual 
      acuity (BCVA), residual cylinders, contrast sensitivity, high order aberration 
      and IOL axis were evaluated preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. 
      Sixty-five eyes (45 patients) had implantation of Acrysof Natural IOL. RESULTS: 
      The UCVA improved in the toric groups three months postoperatively. The UCVA of 
      group T5b was lower than that of the other three groups. The UCVA of toric group 
      was (0.19 ± 0.14) which was better than that of the control group (t = 4.04, P < 
      0.05). The residual cylinder was (1.69 ± 0.68) D in group T5b, which was 
      statistically different from the other three groups. The residual cylinder of the 
      toric group was (0.51 ± 0.78) D, which was much lower than the control group (t = 
      2.54, P < 0.05). The difference of contrast sensitivity between the four toric 
      groups was not statistically significant. The low-order aberration and coma of 
      group T5b was higher than that of the other three groups. The difference of 
      contrast sensitivity between the toric group and the control group was not 
      statistically significant. The low-order aberration and coma of the toric group 
      were lower than those of the control group. The IOLs in 67 eyes (83.75%) rotated 
      less than 5 degrees and all IOLs rotated less than 10 degrees. CONCLUSION: 
      Implantation of the AcrySof toric IOL proves to be an effective, safe, and stable 
      method of managing corneal astigmatism in cataract patients and provides good 
      visual quality.

TI  - Selectivity of retinal photoisomerization in proteorhodopsin is controlled by 
      aspartic acid 227.
PG  - 1648-55
AB  - Similarly to bacteriorhodopsin, proteorhodopsin that normally contains all-trans 
      and 13-cis retinal is transformed at low pH to a species containing 9-cis retinal 
      under continuous illumination at lambda > 530 nm. This species, absorbing around 
      430 nm, returns thermally in tens of minutes to initial pigment and can be 
      reconverted also with blue-light illumination. The yield of the 9-cis species is 
      negligibly small at neutral pH but increases manyfold (>100) at acid pH with a 
      pK(a) of 2.6. This indicates that protonation of acidic group(s) alters the 
      photoreaction pathway that leads normally to all-trans --> 13-cis isomerization. 
      In the D97N mutant, in which one of the two acidic groups in the vicinity of the 
      retinal Schiff base is not ionizable, the yield of 9-cis species at low pH shows 
      a pH dependence similar to that in the wild-type but with a somewhat increased 
      pK(a) of 3.3. In contrast to this relatively minor effect, replacement of the 
      other acidic group, Asp227, with Asn results in a remarkable, more than 50-fold, 
      increase in the yield of the light-induced formation of 9-cis species in the pH 
      range 4-6. It appears that protonation of Asp227 at low pH is what causes the 
      dramatic increase in the yield of the 9-cis species in wild-type proteorhodopsin. 
      We conclude that the photoisomerization pathways in proteorhodopsin to 13-cis or 
      9-cis photoproducts are controlled by the charge state of Asp227.

TI  - Tripping the light fantastic: blue-light photoreceptors as examples of 
      environmentally modulated protein-protein interactions.
PG  - 4-16
AB  - Blue-light photoreceptors play a pivotal role in detecting the quality and 
      quantity of light in the environment, controlling a wide range of biological 
      responses. Several families of blue-light photoreceptors have been characterized 
      in detail using biophysics and biochemistry, beginning with photon absorption, 
      through intervening signal transduction, to regulation of biological activities. 
      Here we review the light oxygen voltage, cryptochrome, and sensors of blue light 
      using FAD families, three different groups of proteins that offer distinctly 
      different modes of photochemical activation and signal transduction yet play 
      similar roles in a vast array of biological responses. We cover mechanisms of 
      light activation and propagation of conformational responses that modulate 
      protein-protein interactions involved in biological signaling. Discovery and 
      characterization of these processes in natural proteins are now allowing the 
      design of photoregulatable engineered proteins, facilitating the generation of 
      novel reagents for biochemical and cell biological research.

PG  - 70-8
LID - 10.3109/02713683.2014.1002043 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the effect of a 50 Hz power line digital filter on the 
      response to a 2-global-flash multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) in primary open 
      angle glaucoma (POAG) compared to control. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 
      2-global-flash mfERG (VERIS™) was recorded (23 control, 34 POAG). Eight 
      recordings were noise contaminated: 4 control, 4 POAG. Response averages from the 
      central 10° and 7 surrounding groups were analyzed with and without a 50 Hz 
      digital filter for the following mfERG response epochs: direct component 
      (15-45 ms), 1st (45-75 ms) and 2nd (75-105 ms) induced components. RESULTS: A 
      digital 50 Hz filter had little effect on uncontaminated with noise waveforms 
      but, in noisy recordings, changed the waveform dramatically to resemble 
      uncontaminated waveforms. In controls' 50 Hz-filtered uncontaminated with noise 
      mfERGs differed significantly from unfiltered responses in induced components. 
      Uncontaminated with noise recordings from glaucoma patients did not differ with 
      or without the notch filter (p > 0.1 for all three epochs of mfERG). The mfERG 
      response in the central 10°in glaucoma patients differed significantly from 
      controls, whether the notch filter was used or not (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A 
      50 Hz notch filter allows grossly contaminated waveforms to be analyzed in a 
      meaningful manner. With a 50 Hz filter, glaucoma patients still differed 
      significantly from normal.

TI  - Visual performance: Comparison of foldable intraocular lenses.
PG  - 451-5
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare best distance visual acuity, color perception, and contrast 
      sensitivity between eyes with an AcrySof Natural intraocular lens (IOL) (Alcon 
      Laboratories Inc.) and fellow eye with an AcrySof IOL and to compare results in 
      the IOL groups to those in normal, similarly aged patients with clear phakic 
      eyes. SETTING: Sri Sankaradeva Nethralaya, Guwahati, India. METHODS: This 
      prospective randomized parallel group single-center patient-masked 
      examiner-masked study comprised 26 eyes of 13 healthy patients with bilateral 
      age-related cataract. All patients had cataract surgery by phacoemulsification in 
      both eyes; 1 eye received an AcrySof Natural IOL (SN60AT) and the fellow eye, an 
      AcrySof (SA60AT) IOL. Final postoperative examination was performed at the end of 
      18 months. In addition to other findings, visual acuity, color perception, and 
      contrast sensitivity were recorded. A group of normal, similarly aged phakic 
      individuals with clear lenses was examined for contrast sensitivity. The records 
      thus obtained were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: The AcrySof and AcrySof 
      Natural IOL groups had a statistically significant improvement in visual acuity 
      and color perception in comparison to preoperative status, and this was 
      maintained until the last postoperative follow-up at 18 months. There was no 
      statistically significant difference in the findings between the 2 IOL groups. 
      The AcrySof and the AcrySof Natural IOL groups showed significant improvement in 
      contrast sensitivity from the preoperative to the postoperative period (both P < 
      .001). However, the AcrySof Natural IOL group was better than the AcrySof IOL 
      group when each group was compared separately to similarly aged phakic 
      individuals with clear lenses. CONCLUSIONS: Pseudophakia following AcrySof 
      Natural SN60AT and AcrySof SA60AT IOL implantation led to equivalent visual 
      acuity and color perception. But the contrast sensitivity in the AcrySof Natural 
      group was better and near normal in reference to a healthy, age-matched control 
      group.

TI  - Comparison between OPD-Scan results and visual outcomes of monofocal and 
      multifocal intraocular lenses.
PG  - 526-32
LID - S0004-27492009000400017 [pii]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the visual outcome, contrast sensitivity and wavefront 
      analysis of patients that underwent cataract surgery and implantation of AcrySof 
      SN60D3 multifocal intraocular lens with those who received the AcrySof SN60AT 
      monofocal IOL. METHODS: This was a prospective clinical trial of forty eyes that 
      received the multifocal IOL and thirty-two eyes that received the monofocal IOL 
      after phacoemulsification. RESULTS: Values for total and spherical aberrations in 
      the multifocal group were statistically lower than in the monofocal group. In the 
      monofocal group, 75% achieved uncorrected intermediate visual acuities between 
      Jaeger 1 and 6. In the multifocal group, 75% of the eyes achieved more than 
      Jaeger 6. At least 87.5% of the multifocal group and 6.3% of the monofocal group 
      achieved monocular uncorrected near acuity of 20/30 (J2, N5) or better. And 90.0% 
      of the eyes in the multifocal group and 37.5% in the monofocal group achieved an 
      uncorrected near acuity of 20/40 (J3, N6) or better. The mean spherical error was 
      0.11 D in the multifocal group and -0.18 D in the monofocal group (p=0.0379). The 
      SN60D3 group compared to SN60AT group had low contrast sensitivity (log units) 
      with statistically significant differences in 6.0 cpd in photopic conditions 
      (p=0.014) and the SN60D3 group compared to SN60AT group had higher contrast 
      sensitivity (log units) under mesopic conditions (p=0.044). CONCLUSION: The 
      multifocal IOLs induced less spherical aberration than monofocal IOLs and 
      predictably good uncorrected distance and uncorrected near acuities. However, 
      contrast sensitivity was lower in the multifocal group.

TI  - Xanthophyll accumulation in the human retina during supplementation with lutein 
      or zeaxanthin - the LUXEA (LUtein Xanthophyll Eye Accumulation) study.
PG  - 128-35
AB  - The xanthophylls lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z) form the macular pigment with the 
      highest density in the macula lutea. We investigated Macular Pigment Optical 
      Density (MPOD) responses to supplementation with identically formulated 
      (Actilease) L or Z (OPTISHARP) or L+Z over 6-12 months using doses of 10 or 
      20mg/day. MPOD as well as blue light sensitivity in fovea and parafovea were 
      measured monthly by heterochromatic flicker photometry. Average xanthophyll 
      plasma concentrations, analysed monthly by HPLC, increased up to 27-fold. MPOD 
      increased by 15% upon L or L+Z supplementation. Supplementation of Z alone 
      produced similar pigment accumulation in fovea and parafovea, which confounded 
      MPOD measurements. After correction for this, a 14% MPOD increase resulted for Z. 
      Thus, during supplementation with xanthophylls, L is predominantly deposited in 
      the fovea while Z deposition appears to cover a wider retinal area. This may be 
      relevant to health and disease of the retina.

PG  - 578-82
LID - 10.1136/bjophthalmol-2013-303094 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: To evaluate wavefront aberrations and subjective quality of life 
      after toric intraocular lens (TIOL) implantation. METHODS: Three groups of 
      subjects who underwent unilateral cataract surgery with intraocular lens (IOL) 
      implantation were compared: (1) toric group (n=40): corneal astigmatism >1.50 D, 
      implanted with Acrysof toric SN60TT IOL (Alcon Inc, Fort Worth,  Texas, USA); (2) 
      astigmatic SN60AT group (n=40): corneal astigmatism >1.50 D, implanted with 
      Acrysof SN60AT IOL; and (3) control group (n=40): corneal astigmatism <1.00 D, 
      implanted with Acrysof SN60AT IOL. Uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), 
      refraction, lower order astigmatism (Z(2)2, Z(-2)2), Strehl ratio and the 
      modulation transfer function area ratio were evaluated over a 3 month follow-up 
      period. A standardised quality of life test (National Eye Institute Refractive 
      Error Quality of Life Instrument-42) was distributed to both astigmatic groups 3 
      months postoperatively. RESULTS: Postoperative UDVA and aberrometric values were 
      significantly better (p<0.001) and mean postoperative spherical equivalent was 
      significantly lower (p<0.05) in the toric and control groups compared with the 
      astigmatic SN60AT group. The toric group had significantly better postoperative 
      quality of life compared with the astigmatic SN60AT group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Acrysof TIOL implantation resulted in better visual, refractive and aberrometric 
      results than SN60AT spherical IOL implantation in astigmatic patients, similar to 
      the control group. The better objective optical and retinal image quality 
      resulted in better subjective quality of life after TIOL implantation.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of blue 
      light-filtering intraocular lenses (IOL) on peripapillary retinal nerve fiber 
      layer (RNFL) thickness measurements by spectral-domain (SD) optical coherence 
      tomography (OCT). METHODS: This prospective study included 50 eyes of 50 
      patients. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a blue 
      light-filtering IOL (acrysof IQ (SN60WF) [Alcon]) or a clear IOL (Tecnis (Z9003) 
      [AMO]). The peripapillary RNFL thickness was measured using a Cirrus SD OCT 
      before and 8 weeks after cataract surgery. Perioperative differences in RNFL 
      thickness measurements and signal strengths (SS) were evaluated and compared in 
      both IOL groups. RESULTS: Thirty-nine eyes of 39 patients were included in the 
      final analysis. There was a significant increase in average RNFL thickness and SS 
      after cataract surgery in both IOL groups. No significant difference in 
      perioperative changes of RNFL measurements was noted between yellow and clear IOL 
      groups. In the multivariable analysis, the factor affecting perioperative 
      differences of RNFL measurements was not IOL type but SS. CONCLUSIONS: Our data 
      suggests that blue-light filtering IOL does not influence RNFL thickness 
      measurements by Cirrus SD-OCT.

TI  - Clinical studies to implement Rheopheresis for age-related macular degeneration 
      guided by evidence-based-medicine.
PG  - 71-84
AB  - In the majority of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients the 
      therapeutic situation is very unsatisfactory, especially for patients with dry 
      AMD. Rheopheresis is a safe and effective modality of therapeutic apheresis to 
      treat microcirculatory disorders, and represents a novel therapeutic approach for 
      patients with dry AMD and soft drusen. Elimination of a defined spectrum of high 
      molecular weight proteins from human plasma including pathophysiologically 
      relevant risk factors for AMD such as fibrinogen, LDL-cholesterol, alpha 
      2-macroglobulin, fibronectin, and von-Willebrand factor results in the reduction 
      of blood and plasma viscosity as well as erythrocyte and thrombocyte aggregation. 
      Pulses of lowering blood and plasma viscosity performed as series of Rheopheresis 
      treatments lead to rapid changes of blood flow, subsequently inducing sustained 
      improvement of microcirculation, and recovery of retinal function. Two controlled 
      randomized clinical trials demonstrated safety and efficacy of Rheopheresis for 
      the treatment of AMD patients, especially with the dry form. Recently the 
      interim-analysis of the sham-controlled, double blinded, randomized multicenter 
      MIRA-I trial confirmed these results. The RheoNet-registry and the development 
      and continuous update of therapy guidelines provide an appropriate framework for 
      the quality management of the interdisciplinary cooperation between 
      ophthalmologists with apheresis specialists. A hypothesis based upon current 
      knowledge of pathogenic mechanisms of the development and progression of AMD can 
      be conclusively linked with the putative mechanism of action of Rheopheresis for 
      AMD. A recommendation for high-risk AMD-patients was defined. Based on the 
      positive results of the MIRA-1 interim analysis eight Rheopheresis treatments are 
      currently recommended as the initial treatment series.

TI  - Edge profile of commercially available square-edged intraocular lenses.
PG  - 677-86
LID - 10.1016/j.jcrs.2007.12.024 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the sharpness of the posterior optic edge profile and edge 
      thickness of intraocular lenses (IOLs) marketed with a square-edged profile. 
      SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, St. Thomas' Hospital, London, United 
      Kingdom. METHODS: Seventeen square-edged 20.0 diopter IOLs of different 
      manufacture, design, and material were selected. After the environmental scanning 
      electron microscopy technique was standardized, repeatability of the technique 
      was tested. Posterior optic edges of all IOLs were scanned at a magnification of 
      x 500. Local radii of curvature of the posterior optic edges were measured by 
      purpose-designed software. Optic edge thickness was also measured from the 
      electron micrographs. RESULTS: The repeatability of the scanning technique was 
      excellent (+/-0.10 microm). The radius of curvature of posterior optic edges 
      ranged from 7.6 to 23.1 microm. Hydrophilic acrylic IOLs (except the HumanOptics 
      MC Microlens 611 MI-B and 1CU) had radii of curvatures more than 10.0 microm of 
      the posterior optic edge compared with hydrophobic acrylic and silicone IOLs 
      (<10.0 microm) except the Hoya AF-1 (19.9 microm). Alcon AcrySof single-piece 
      (SN60WF), HumanOptics 1CU, and AMO Clariflex CLRFLXC IOLs had the thinnest optic 
      edges in the hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and silicone groups, respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Commercially marketed square-edged IOLs differed in the sharpness of 
      the posterior optic edge. Hydrophobic acrylic and silicone IOLs have sharper 
      posterior optic square edge than most hydrophilic acrylic IOLs. This probably 
      reflects difference in manufacturing techniques. Differences in posterior optic 
      edge profile may explain variation in posterior capsule opacification performance 
      with different IOLs and materials.

TI  - All-distance visual acuity in eyes with a nontinted or a yellow-tinted 
      diffractive multifocal intraocular lens.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare all-distance visual acuity (VA) between eyes with a nontinted 
      diffractive multifocal intraocular lens (IOL), a yellow-tinted multifocal IOL, 
      and a nontinted monofocal IOL. METHODS: Thirty-four patients underwent bilateral 
      implantation of a nontinted multifocal IOL (Alcon ReSTOR), 30 received a 
      yellow-tinted multifocal IOL (ReSTOR Natural), and 17 a monofocal IOL. 
      All-distance VA was measured with an all-distance vision tester at 12 months 
      postoperatively. The relationships between pupillary diameter and IOL 
      decentration and tilt with VA were determined. RESULTS: Both uncorrected and best 
      distance-corrected near VA in the multifocal groups were significantly better 
      than those in the monofocal group, whereas no significant differences were found 
      in far-to-intermediate VAs. There was no significant difference in all-distance 
      VA between the nontinted and yellow-tinted multifocal groups. In the multifocal 
      groups, a larger pupillary diameter was associated with better near VA, whereas 
      there was no correlation between VA and IOL decentration and tilt. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Near VA with a diffractive multifocal IOL was better than that with a monofocal 
      IOL, although far-to-intermediate VAs were similar. All-distance VA with the 
      nontinted multifocal IOL was similar to that with the yellow-tinted multifocal 
      IOL. Larger pupillary diameter was associated with better near VA with the 
      multifocal IOL.

TI  - The Effect of Cataract Surgery on Circadian Photoentrainment: A Randomized Trial 
      of Blue-Blocking versus Neutral Intraocular Lenses.

AB  - PURPOSE: Cataract decreases blue light transmission. Because of the selective 
      blue light sensitivity of the retinal ganglion cells governing circadian 
      photoentrainment, cataract may interfere with normal sleep-wake regulation and 
      cause sleep disturbances. The purpose was to investigate the effect of cataract 
      surgery on circadian photoentrainment and to determine any difference between 
      blue-blocking and neutral intraocular lenses (IOLs). DESIGN: The study was a 
      single-center, investigator-driven, double-masked, block-randomized clinical 
      trial. PARTICIPANTS: One eye in 76 patients with bilateral age-related cataract 
      eligible for cataract surgery was included. METHODS: Intervention was cataract 
      surgery by phacoemulsification. Patients were randomized to receive a 
      blue-blocking or neutral IOL. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was 
      activation of intrinsic photosensitive ganglion cells using post-illumination 
      pupil response (PIPR) to blue light from 10 to 30 seconds after light exposure as 
      a surrogate measure. Secondary outcomes were circadian rhythm analysis using 
      actigraphy and 24-hour salivary melatonin measurements. Finally, objective and 
      subjective sleep quality were determined by actigraphy and the Pittsburgh Sleep 
      Quality Index. RESULTS: The blue light PIPR increased 2 days (17%) and 3 weeks 
      (24%) after surgery (P < 0.001). The majority of circadian and sleep-specific 
      actigraphy parameters did not change after surgery. A forward shift of the 
      circadian rhythm by 22 minutes (P = 0.004) for actigraphy and a tendency toward 
      an earlier melatonin onset (P = 0.095) were found. Peak salivary melatonin 
      concentration increased after surgery (P = 0.037). No difference was detected 
      between blue-blocking and neutral IOLs, whereas low preoperative blue light 
      transmission was inversely associated with an increase in PIPR (P = 0.021) and 
      sleep efficiency (P = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: Cataract surgery increases 
      photoreception by the photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. Because of 
      inconsistency between the significant findings and the many parameters that were 
      unchanged, we can conclude that cataract surgery does not adversely affect the 
      circadian rhythm or sleep. Longer follow-up time and fellow eye surgery may 
      reveal the significance of the subtle changes observed. We found no difference 
      between blue-blocking and neutral IOLs, and, because of the minor effect of 
      surgery in itself, an effect of IOL type seems highly unlikely.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the quality of vision with aspheric and spherical intraocular 
      lenses (IOLs) in pseudophakic patients after long-term follow-up. METHODS: Two 
      hundred eyes of 100 patients with bilateral cataracts were randomly assigned to 
      receive spherical (Acrysof SN60AT [Alcon Laboratories Inc] or Sensar AR40e 
      [Advanced Medical Optics Inc]) or aspheric IOLs (Acrysof SN60WF [Alcon] or Tecnis 
      Z9000 [Advanced Medical Optics]). Ophthalmologic examination, including best 
      spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), pupil size, ocular dominance, contrast 
      sensitivity under mesopic and photopic conditions, and wavefront analysis, was 
      performed 2 months and 1 and 2 years after surgery. RESULTS: No statistically 
      significant differences among the four groups in terms of age, pupil diameter, 
      postoperative BSCVA, comeal spherical aberration, and posterior capsular 
      opacification were noted. At all followup examinations, contrast sensitivity 
      results showed no significant differences between the two aspheric IOLs at all 
      spatial frequencies. Under photopic conditions, significant differences (P<.05) 
      between spherical and aspheric IOLs were detected for spatial frequencies of 12 
      and 18 cycles per degree (cpd) at 2 months and 2 years and 12 cpd at 1 year. 
      Under mesopic conditions, significant differences (P<.05) were detected between 
      spherical and aspheric IOLs for all spatial frequencies at 2 months; all spatial 
      frequencies except 18 cpd at 1 year; and spatial frequencies of 3, 12, and 18 cpd 
      at 2 years. In addition, aspheric IOLs had statistical reductions in total 
      spherical aberration at all follow-up examinations (P<.01). CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study confirms that implantation of a modified aspheric IOL improves functional 
      visual performance at 2 years postoperative.

AB  - PURPOSE: To observe changes in fundus autofluorescence 2 years after implantation 
      of blue light-filtering (yellow-tinted) and ultraviolet light-filtering 
      (colorless) intraocular lenses (IOLs). SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology and 
      Visual Science, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, 
      Nagoya, Japan, and the Department of Ophthalmology, University of Bern, Bern, 
      Switzerland. DESIGN: Prospective comparative observational study. METHODS: 
      Patients were enrolled who had cataract surgery with implantation of a 
      yellow-tinted or colorless IOL and for whom images were obtained on which the 
      fundus autofluorescence was measurable using the Heidelberg Retina Angiogram 2 
      postoperatively. The fundus autofluorescence in the images was classified into 8 
      abnormal patterns based on the classification of the International Fundus 
      Autofluorescence Classification Group, The presence of normal fundus 
      autofluorescence, geographic atrophy, and wet age-related macular degeneration 
      (AMD) also was recorded. The fundus findings at baseline and 2 years 
      postoperatively were compared. RESULTS: Fifty-two eyes with a yellow-tinted IOL 
      and 79 eyes with a colorless IOL were included. Abnormal fundus autofluorescence 
      did not develop or increase in the yellow-tinted IOL group; however, progressive 
      abnormal fundus autofluorescence developed or increased in 12 eyes (15.2%) in the 
      colorless IOL group (P = .0016). New drusen, geographic atrophy, and choroidal 
      neovascularization were observed mainly in the colorless IOL group. The incidence 
      of AMD was statistically significantly higher in the colorless IOL group (P = 
      .042). CONCLUSIONS: Two years after cataract surgery, significant differences 
      were seen in the progression of abnormal fundus autofluorescence between the 2 
      groups. The incidence of AMD was lower in eyes with a yellow-tinted IOL.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of blue-light-filtering intraocular lenses (IOLs) 
      with a yellow chromophore on color contrast sensitivity by intraindividual 
      comparison with an identically designed IOL without a blue-light filter. SETTING: 
      Medical University of Vienna, Department of Ophthalmology, Vienna, Austria. 
      METHODS: Randomized implantation of an AF-1 (UV) IOL (Hoya) in 1 eye and an AF-1 
      (UY) IOL (Hoya) in the contralateral eye was performed after phacoemulsification 
      and primary posterior curvilinear capsulorhexis. Three months postoperatively, 
      the best distance-corrected visual acuity was evaluated. Before color contrast 
      sensitivity testing, a heterochromatic flicker test was performed in both eyes to 
      avoid error in brightness matching. Central and peripheral tritan color contrast 
      sensitivities were evaluated using the Moorfields Vision System (CH Electronics). 
      RESULTS: Visual acuity did not differ significantly between the 2 IOL groups 
      (P>.05). The central color contrast sensitivity threshold also did not differ 
      significantly between eyes with a clear IOL and eyes with a yellow IOL at any 
      tested spatial frequency. The peripheral color contrast sensitivity test showed 
      slightly higher color contrast sensitivity thresholds in eyes with a yellow IOL, 
      although the differences were not statistically significant. Two patients 
      independently reported subjective changes in color perception in the eye with the 
      yellow IOL. CONCLUSION: In this intraindividual comparison, the implantation of a 
      blue-light-filtering IOL did not lead to a clinically significant change in color 
      contrast sensitivity.

TI  - Zeaxanthin is bioavailable from genetically modified zeaxanthin-rich potatoes.
PG  - 99-103
LID - 10.1007/s00394-008-0702-2 [doi]
AB  - The carotenoid zeaxanthin accumulates in the human macula lutea and protects 
      retinal cells from blue light damage. However, zeaxanthin intake from food 
      sources is low. Increasing zeaxanthin in common foods such as potatoes by 
      traditional plant breeding or by genetic engineering could contribute to an 
      increased intake of this carotenoid and, consequently, to a decreased risk of 
      age-related macular degeneration. Our aim was to investigate whether zeaxanthin 
      from genetically modified zeaxanthin-rich potatoes is bioavailable in humans. 
      Three men participated in this randomized, controlled double-blinded, crossover 
      pilot study. All subjects consumed 1,100 g of mashed potatoes, either genetically 
      modified (Solanum tuberosum L. var. Baltica GM47/18; 3 mg zeaxanthin) or 
      wild-type control potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L. var. Baltica; 0.14 mg 
      zeaxanthin). A second treatment was followed after a 7-day wash-out period. The 
      concentration of zeaxanthin was significantly increased in chylomicrons after 
      consumption of genetically modified potatoes and 0.27 mg of the 3 mg zeaxanthin 
      dose could be detected in chylomicrons. Consumption of control potatoes had no 
      effect on concentrations of zeaxanthin in chylomicrons. After normalization of 
      chylomicron zeaxanthin for plasma triacylglycerol, the time course of zeaxanthin 
      concentrations peaked at 7 h after consumption of genetically modified potatoes. 
      There were no significant differences in the concentrations of other major potato 
      carotenoids such as lutein and beta-carotene in chylomicrons after consumption of 
      genetically modified and wild type control potatoes. Thus, consumption of 
      zeaxanthin-rich potatoes significantly increases chylomicron zeaxanthin 
      concentrations suggesting that potentially such potatoes could be used as an 
      important dietary source of zeaxanthin.

TI  - Spherical aberration and depth of focus in eyes implanted with aspheric and 
      spherical intraocular lenses: a prospective randomized study.
PG  - 2050-4
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare distance-corrected, near, and intermediate visual acuities as 
      a measurement of depth of focus and spherical aberration of eyes implanted with 
      aspheric and spherical intraocular lenses (IOLs). DESIGN: Randomized prospective 
      study. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred twenty eyes of 60 patients with bilateral 
      cataract implanted with 3 IOL models (AcrySof IQ, AcrySof SN60AT [Alcon 
      Laboratories, Fort Worth, TX], and Sensar AR40 [Allergan Surgical, Irvine, CA]). 
      METHODS: Pupil diameter was analyzed by using a Colvard pupillometer (OASIS 
      Medical, Inc., Glendora, CA) under photopic, mesopic, and scotopic conditions. 
      Distance (6 m), intermediate (1 m), and near (0.33 m) visual acuities were 
      measured with distance correction in place 90 days after surgery. Wavefront 
      analysis (LadarWave; Alcon Laboratories) was performed using 5-mm and measured 
      photopic pupil diameter at 30 and 90 days after surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      To evaluate spherical aberration and depth of focus (by means of 
      distance-corrected near and intermediate visual acuity) in patients implanted 
      with aspheric and spherical IOLs. RESULTS: Photopic pupil sizes in each group 
      were similar at 30 days after surgery. At 90 days after surgery, mean logarithm 
      of the minimum angle of resolution distance-corrected near visual acuity 
      (+/-standard deviation [SD]) was 0.50+/-0.20 in the AcrySof IQ group, 0.38+/-0.17 
      in the AcrySof SN60AT group, and 0.45+/-0.16 in Sensar AR40 group. Mean spherical 
      aberration values (+/-SD) were 0.03+/-0.05 microm in the AcrySof IQ group, 
      0.24+/-0.04 microm in the AcrySof SN60AT group, and 0.14+/-0.07 microm in the 
      Sensar AR40 group. The AcrySof IQ group showed a statistically significant lower 
      induction of spherical aberration and worse distance-corrected near visual 
      acuity. The AcrySof SN60AT group showed statistically significant higher mean 
      spherical aberration values and better distance-corrected near and intermediate 
      visual acuity. CONCLUSIONS: The reduction of total spherical aberration after 
      aspheric IOL implantation may degrade distance-corrected near and intermediate 
      visual acuity.

TI  - Tomato contains homologues of Arabidopsis cryptochromes 1 and 2.
PG  - 765-73
AB  - Cryptochromes are blue light photoreceptors found in both plants and animals. 
      They probably evolved from photolyases, which are blue/UV-light-absorbing 
      photoreceptors involved in DNA repair. In seed plants, two different cryptochrome 
      (CRY) genes have been found in Arabidopsis and one in Sinapis, while three genes 
      have been found in the fern Adiantum. We report the characterisation of tomato 
      CRY genes CRY1 and CRY2. They map to chromosomes 4 and 9, respectively, show 
      relatively constitutive expression and encode proteins of 679 and 635 amino 
      acids, respectively. These proteins show higher similarity to their Arabidopsis 
      counterparts than to each other, suggesting that duplication between CRY1 and 
      CRY2 is an ancient event in the evolution of seed plants. The seed plant 
      cryptochromes form a group distinct from the fern cryptochromes, implying that 
      only one gene was present in the common ancestor between these two groups of 
      plants. Most intron positions in CRY genes from plants and ferns are highly 
      conserved. Tomato cryl and cry2 proteins carry C-terminal domains 210 and 160 
      amino acids long, respectively. Several conserved motifs are found in these 
      domains, some of which are common to both types of cryptochromes, while others 
      are cryptochrome-type-specific.

TI  - The diagnostic accuracy of chromatic pupillary light responses in diseases of the 
      outer and inner retina.
PG  - 519-527
LID - 10.1007/s00417-016-3496-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the chromatic pupillary light responses (PLR) in healthy 
      subjects with those from patients with diseases of the outer or inner retina 
      under various stimulus conditions, and to ascertain the parameters required to 
      optimally distinguish between disease and control groups. METHODS: Fifteen 
      patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), 19 patients with optic nerve disease 
      (ON), and 16 healthy subjects were enrolled in this prospective study. ON 
      included optic neuritis (NNO) and non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic 
      neuropathy (NAION). For each subject, the PLR was recorded, to red, yellow, 
      green, and blue stimuli for durations of 4 and 12 s, and for stimulus intensities 
      of 4 lx and 28 lx. RESULTS: Comparison between control and RP or ON patient 
      results showed that responses after stimulus onset were significantly different 
      for most stimulus conditions, but the post-stimulus amplitudes at 3 s and 7 s 
      after light extinction were not. On the other hand, the difference between the ON 
      and RP groups was significant only for post-stimuli time-points and only for blue 
      stimuli. Differences between responses to blue and red were significantly 
      different, predominantly at post stimulus time-points. A ROC analysis revealed 
      that the maximal constriction amplitudes to a 4 lx, 4 s yellow stimulus are 
      significantly different in ON vs RP patients, and the responses to a 4 s, 28 lx 
      blue stimulus at 7 s post-stimulus are significantly different in controls vs ON 
      vs RP patients with a high specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Pupillary light responses to 
      blue light in healthy, RP, and ON subjects are significantly different from one 
      another. The optimal stimuli for future protocols was found to be a 4 s blue 
      stimulus at 28 lx, and a 4 s yellow stimulus at 4 lx.

PG  - 265-77
LID - 10.1016/j.ajo.2009.08.020 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the ability of novel dyes to stain lens capsule (LC), 
      internal limiting membrane (ILM), epiretinal membrane (ERM), and vitreous. 
      DESIGN: Experimental study in animal and human donor eyes. METHODS: Thirteen 
      dyes, methyl violet, crystal violet, eosin Y, sudan black B, methylene blue, 
      toluidine blue, light green, indigo carmine, fast green, congo red, evans blue, 
      brilliant blue, and bromophenol blue, were injected onto the LC and ILM of 
      enucleated porcine eyes. The vitreous was stained with 2 mL of dyes for 1 minute. 
      Six dyes (indigo carmine, evans blue, fast green, light green, bromophenol blue, 
      and brilliant blue) were selected for experiments in human donor eyes and freshly 
      removed ERM. RESULTS: In the porcine eyes, ILM staining with methylene blue, 
      toluidine blue, indigo carmine, evans blue, bromophenol blue, and fast green was 
      moderate, and methyl violet, crystal violet, brilliant blue, or sudan black 
      resulted in strong staining. Methyl violet, crystal violet, sudan black, 
      toluidine blue, and methylene blue caused histologic damage in porcine retinas. 
      Vitreous examination revealed moderate staining with congo red, crystal violet, 
      fast green, eosin Y, methylene blue, toluidine blue, brilliant blue, bromophenol 
      blue, and methyl violet and strong staining with light green and evans blue. ERMs 
      showed strong staining with 0.5% evans blue and moderate staining with 0.5% light 
      green, fast green, brilliant blue, and bromophenol blue. Evaluation of donor eyes 
      disclosed moderate staining with evans blue, light green, and bromophenol blue 
      and strong staining with 0.5% brilliant blue. Moderate or strong staining of the 
      vitreous occurred with most dyes. LC evaluation showed moderate staining with 
      0.5% evans blue, fast green, and brilliant blue, whereas 0.5% light green 
      produced strong LC staining. CONCLUSIONS: Brilliant blue shows the best ILM 
      staining, whereas bromophenol blue, evans blue, and light green also stain ILM. 
      Most dyes bind well to LC, vitreous, and ERM.

TI  - Visual axis opacification after cataract surgery and hydrophobic acrylic 
      intraocular lens implantation in the first year of life.

AB  - PURPOSE: To report the incidence of visual axis opacification (VAO) requiring 
      surgery after cataract extraction with hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lens (IOL) 
      implantation during the first year of life. SETTING: Storm Eye Institute, 
      Charleston, South Carolina, USA; Iladevi Cataract and IOL Research Center, 
      Ahmedabad, India. DESIGN: Cohort study. METHODS: Medical records of patients 
      younger than 1 year who had primary posterior capsulectomy, vitrectomy, and 
      in-the-bag hydrophobic acrylic IOL implantation were reviewed. In bilateral 
      cases, 1 eye was randomly chosen. The need for surgery for visually significant 
      VAO was evaluated 12 months after cataract surgery. RESULTS: Seventy-two eyes 
      were included. The mean age at cataract surgery was 6.0 months. Seventeen eyes 
      (23.6%) required surgery for VAO a mean of 6.2 ± 2.9 months postoperatively. The 
      odds for VAO surgery were 3.5 times greater in eyes of female children than in 
      eyes of male children. For AcrySof MA60AC, SA60AT, SN60AT, or SN60WF IOLs, 
      surgery for VAO was required in 25%, 23%, 23%, and 23% of eyes, respectively. The 
      earliest time between cataract and secondary VAO surgery was relatively later 
      (9.0 months) with the SN60WF IOL than with the MA60AC, SA60AT, or SN60AT IOL 
      (4.4, 2.2, and 2.0 months, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 25% of operated 
      eyes of infants required a secondary surgical procedure for VAO; the rate was 
      higher in eyes of female infants but did not differ between IOL models. The data 
      indicate that surgery for VAO is required later in eyes with an SN60WF IOL than 
      in eyes in which other AcrySof IOLs were used. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE: No author

TI  - Effect of a blue-light-blocking intraocular lens on the quality of sleep.
PG  - 83-8
LID - 10.1016/j.jcrs.2008.10.015 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate whether implantation of a blue-light-blocking intraocular 
      lens (IOL) affects sleep quality. SETTING: Repatriation General Hospital, 
      Adelaide, Australia. METHODS: This study comprised patients who had bilateral 
      cataract surgery during the preceding 12 months with implantation of a 
      conventional SI40NB IOL or an AcrySof Natural SN60WF blue-light-blocking IOL. 
      Patients were contacted by telephone at least 6 months after second-eye surgery, 
      and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire was administered. 
      Results were compared between groups. RESULTS: Of the 49 patients, 31 received 
      conventional IOLs and 18, blue-light-blocking IOLs. The mean age of the patients 
      was 80 years +/- 8.1 (SD). The median PSQI score was 6 (interquartile range 3 to 
      8). There were no statistically significant differences in PSQI scores between 
      the 2 IOL groups (P = .65). This remained true after adjustment for sex, age, 
      medication, and time since surgery. CONCLUSION: The blue-light-blocking IOL had 
      no effect on the sleep quality of patients, indicating that these IOLs might 
      serve as an alternative to conventional IOLs without a detrimental effect on 
      circadian rhythm.
